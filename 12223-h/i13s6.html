        <p>"And by the way," continued the Colonel, "a curious thing about
        this Josiah Wilson was that he was married for fifteen years and
        never had any wife whatever."</p>

        <p>The Colonel had begun a story concerning one Josiah Wilson, which
        promised to be interesting, but his incidental allusion to Mr.
        Wilson's matrimonial experience awakened our curiosity, and we begged
        him to interrupt his narrative long enough to tell us how it came to
        pass that Josiah was a married man who never had a wife.</p>

            "HOWLED FOR HELP."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"The marriage laws in the United States," said the Colonel, giving
        his chair an increased tilt backwards, which was his usual way of
        beginning a fresh anecdote, "are as peculiar in their way as are the
        divorce laws. You would think to look at them that they would permit
        anybody to marry anybody else in any way that either of them might
        choose, but for all that they sometimes make it impossible for a man
        or a woman to get married. There was a couple who intended to be
        married in a balloon, which is a style of lunacy that is quite
        fashionable in some parts of the country, though I can't see why a
        man should want to risk his neck in a balloon on his wedding day
        unless it is that it takes so much courage to be married at all that
        a man forgets all about such minor dangers as are connected with
        ballooning. The bride, the minister, and two witnesses of assorted
        sexes went up in the balloon at the appointed time, and, naturally,
        the bridegroom intended to go with them, but he accidentally caught
        his foot in a neglected guy-rope, and went up head downwards about
        twenty feet below the car. The party in the balloon could not haul
        him up because they could not get hold of the rope, and the bride
        would not consent to give up the trip, because the groom had always
        been a little shy, and she was afraid that, if she let him go this
        time, she might not be able to land him again. So the parson went on
        with the ceremony, and the groom made most of his responses in bad
        language, and howled for help when he wasn't swearing. When the
        ceremony was over, the aeronaut managed to land the balloon without
        seriously damaging the bridegroom, but when, a year or two
        afterwards, the bride wanted to get her divorce, the court held that
        there had never been any marriage, for the reason that both the groom
        and the bride had not appeared together in the presence of the
        officiating minister, and that, furthermore, there was no provision
        in the law which would permit a man to be married upside down.</p>

            "SMITH'S BULL-DOG."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"But to get back to Josiah Wilson. He lived in Indiana, close to
        the boundary line between that State and Illinois, and he courted
        Melinda Smith, a young woman who lived a little way up the mountain
        side with her father and three brothers. The girl was anxious to be
        married, but her family was dead against it. You see Josiah was a
        Republican and a Methodist, while the Smiths were Democrats and
        Baptists, and, naturally, they hated each other like poison, and one
        night as old man Smith and Josiah met on their way to rival prayer
        meetings, they exchanged revolver shots, without, however, doing any
        harm. Then once Josiah had most of the calf of his leg taken off by
        the Smiths' bull-dog, and twice the Smith boys came into the
        sitting-room where Josiah was calling on Melinda, and suggested to
        him with their shot-guns that he had better go home. Gradually Josiah
        and Melinda came to the conclusion that her family was resolved to
        discourage the match, so they determined to elope and be married
        without the knowledge or consent of anybody.</p>

        <p>"One dark night Josiah carried a ladder and planted it under
        Melinda's window. He had advised her to walk out of the front door,
        which was always left unlocked at night, but she refused, saying that
        if she was going to elope she should do it in the proper way, and
        that if Josiah had no respect for her, she had some little respect
        for herself. She climbed down the ladder with a good deal of
        difficulty, because she insisted that Josiah should help her, and
        also that he should stand forty yards away, for reasons connected
        with her ankles, and he found it rather trying to follow out these
        contradictory orders. However, Melinda reached the ground at last,
        and the pair started in a carriage that had been waiting just around
        a bend in the road, in company with the Methodist minister. Their
        plan was to drive to the next town and there to be married, but it
        happened that one of the Smith boys, being restless, got up in the
        night, and, looking out of the window, saw the ladder standing at
        Melinda's window. In about twenty minutes after the young people had
        started, the whole Smith family and their shot-guns were following
        the runaways in a waggon, and gaining on them fast.</p>

        <p>"The Methodist minister, whose hearing was unusually good, heard
        the sound of hoofs before Josiah noticed it, and told the young
        people that there was not the least doubt that they were pursued, and
        would be overtaken in a very few minutes. 'And then, you know,' he
        added, 'the chances are that, being Baptists, they will shoot first,
        and ask for explanations afterwards. The only thing for us to do is
        to get the marriage ceremony over before they come up. Then they will
        see that opposition is of no use, and will listen to reason.'</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/065-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/065-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "THEY WERE MARRIED."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Josiah and Melinda at once consented, and the parson, noticing a
        little clearing in the woods on the left hand side of the road, and a
        flat sort of tombstone standing in the middle of it, said that he
        would stand on that stone and marry his young friends so quick that
        it would make their hair curl. He was particularly glad to meet with
        a handy tombstone, for he said that a tombstone was the next thing to
        a church, and that to be married by the side of a tomb would be
        almost as solemn as to be married in a minister's study. So the party
        hastily descended; the parson mounted the stone; Josiah and Melinda
        joined hands in front of him, and they were married, and the parson
        had kissed the bride and pocketed his fee just as the Smiths' waggon
        drove up and the Smith boys cocked their guns and covered the party.
        But the parson was wide awake. He had his revolver out and old man
        Smith covered before anybody had taken aim at him, but, instead of
        shooting, he remarked that he was a minister of the blessed gospel of
        peace; that there was no necessity for bloodshed, and that he would
        blow a hole through old Smith unless the Smith boys lowered their
        weapons and consented to argue the matter. 'The fact is, Colonel
        Smith,' said the parson, 'you're too late. The young people are
        legally married, and the sooner you accept the situation the better.
        I married them not two minutes ago, standing on that identical
        tombstone.'</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/066-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/066-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "'YOU'LL COME STRAIGHT HOME WITH ME.'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Colonel Smith was a lawyer, and the sharpest one in that part of
        the country. He saw the force of the minister's remarks, so he told
        the boys to put up their guns, and he shook hands with the minister.
        Then he inquired, in a careless sort of way, where Josiah and Melinda
        had stood while they were being married. The parson showed the
        footprints of the bride and groom, and then Colonel Smith turned to
        Melinda and said, 'You'll come straight home with me. There hasn't
        been any marriage yet. That stone is the boundary mark between
        Indiana and Illinois, and you were standing in Indiana and that other
        idiot was standing in Illinois when the parson tried to marry you.
        Nobody can marry in two States at the same time, and I shan't
        recognise the pretended marriage till a court of law compels me to do
        so, which will be never. I hope this will teach you the folly of
        fooling with Methodism. When you want to get married next time try a
        Baptist minister, who will know the difference between a tombstone
        and a boundary mark.' There were too many Smiths, and they were too
        well armed to be reasoned with successfully, so the upshot was that
        Melinda went home with her family, and Josiah and the parson went to
        see a lawyer.</p>

        <p>"The next day Josiah brought a suit for divorce against Melinda.
        It was a friendly suit, you understand, and his only object was to
        test the question of the validity of his marriage, for, of course, no
        man can get a divorce unless he first proves that he is married. Old
        man Smith conducted the case on his side, and a lawyer named
        Starkweather, who is now a member of the Illinois Legislature,
        appeared for Josiah Wilson. Colonel Smith argued that while the
        parson who conducted the alleged marriage ceremony could undoubtedly
        have married a couple in the State of Indiana, he could not marry a
        woman in Indiana to a man in Illinois, for the reason that the man
        and the woman could not be in the same place while they were in two
        different commonwealths, and that hence Josiah and Melinda had not
        legally appeared together before the officiating minister.
        Furthermore, he argued that the minister at the time of the pretended
        marriage was standing neither in Indiana nor in Illinois, but on the
        boundary line; that the statute defined the boundary line as 'an
        imaginary line' running from such and such a point to such and such a
        point, and that a minister who stands in a purely imaginative
        locality stands virtually nowhere, and hence cannot perform any
        function of his calling.</p>

        <p>"On the other hand, Josiah's lawyer claimed that the minister had
        married Melinda Smith in the State of Indiana; that consequently she
        must have been married to somebody, and that that somebody was
        unquestionably Josiah Wilson. As to the point that the minister stood
        in an imaginary locality because, as was alleged, he stood on the
        boundary line, the lawyer maintained that it was a physical
        impossibility that a minister weighing two hundred and fifty pounds
        could stand in a purely imaginative place. Moreover, he was prepared
        to prove that, while performing the ceremony, at least one of the
        minister's feet was in the State of Indiana, which was sufficient to
        make him legally present in that State.</p>

        <p>"The arguments lasted three days, and the court before which it
        was tried, consisting of three judges, took all the third day to
        deliver its verdict. It decided that Melinda Smith was legally
        married to some person unknown, though not to Josiah Wilson, and that
        Josiah Wilson was also married to some unknown woman, who was not
        Melinda Smith, whoever else she might be; that no marriage between
        the plaintiff and the defendant had ever taken place, and that no
        divorce could be granted, but that if either of them married anyone
        else, he or she would be guilty of bigamy.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:30%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/068-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/068-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL CAST DOWN."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"The Smiths, with the exception of Melinda, were delighted with
        the decision, for it made it reasonably certain that Josiah could
        never be recognised as her husband. She was a good deal cast down
        about it, for, like every other Indiana girl, she had looked forward
        to being married and divorced as the natural lot of woman. Now it
        appeared that she was married, but in such an unsatisfactory way,
        that she could never have a husband, and never be divorced from
        anyone. As for Josiah, he was furious, but there was no help for it,
        the law was against him, and, as a law-abiding man, he was obliged to
        respect it, especially as he could not hope to kill off all four of
        the Smiths, if he decided to make a family feud of it; he himself
        having no family whatever, and no one to help him to keep up his end
        of the feud.</p>

        <p>"For the next fifteen years Josiah lived a single man except in
        name, and Melinda mourned her hard fate and kept house for her father
        and brothers; but one day Josiah's lawyer, who was by this time in
        the Legislature, came to him and offered to have his marriage to
        Melinda made legal in all respects for five hundred dollars. The
        lawyer was so certain that he could do this that he was willing to
        wait for his pay until after he had gained a verdict, and Josiah,
        after a little bargaining such as every self-respecting man would
        have made, in his place, consented to the lawyer's terms. It seems
        that the lawyer had accidentally discovered that there had been a
        mistake in the survey of part of the boundary line between Indiana
        and Illinois, and at the very place where Josiah and Melinda were
        married, A rectification of this mistake would move the line ten feet
        west, and so place the spot where the pair stood during their wedding
        entirely within the state of Indiana. The proper steps to obtain the
        rectification of the boundary were taken, and it was rectified. Then
        Melinda in her turn began a suit for divorce against Josiah, and had
        no difficulty in proving the marriage and in obtaining a decree.
        Josiah paid the lawyer his five hundred dollars, and was overjoyed at
        being finally able to call his Melinda his own. But he met with a
        little disappointment. Now that Melinda had obtained her divorce she
        thought she might as well live up to it, and marry a fresh husband.
        So she married the Methodist minister, who had just lost his third
        wife, and lived happily ever afterwards.</p>

        <p class="figure" style="clear:both;"><a href=

        "" /></a><br />
        "OFFERED TO HAVE HIS MARRIAGE MADE LEGAL."</p>

        <p>"It was just after this that Josiah, being perhaps made a little
        reckless by his disappointment, became involved in the affair that I
        was going to tell you about when you interrupted me, and wanted to
        hear about his marriage. Matrimony is a mighty curious thing, and you
        can never tell precisely how it is going to turn out. That is one
        reason why I was never married but once, though I spent ten years of
        my life in Chicago, and had friends at bar who stood ready to obtain
        divorces for me at any moment and without a dollar of expense."</p>
