            "ANDREAS."</p>
        </div>

        <p>I think it quite likely that some of my young American friends,
        about ten months ago, were burning to have an opportunity of
        accompanying General Miles down the Pacific coast, and of describing
        in glowing sentences to their countrymen at home how Uncle Sam's
        young man turned to flight the Chilian insurrectionists, who were
        breathing out threatening and slaughter against the great Northern
        Republic. There is an undoubted fascination in the picturesque and
        adventurous life of the war correspondent. One must, of course, have
        a distinct bent for the avocation, and if he is to succeed he must
        possess certain salient attributes. He must expose himself to rather
        greater risks than fall to the lot of the average fighting man,
        without enjoying any of the happiness of retaliation which stirs the
        blood of the latter; the correspondent must sit quietly on his horse
        in the fire, and, while watching every turn in the battle, must wear
        the aspect as if he rather enjoyed the storm of missiles than
        otherwise. When the fighting is over, the soldier, if not killed,
        generally can eat and sleep; ere the echoes of it are silent, the
        correspondent of energy&mdash;and if he has not energy he is not
        worth his salt&mdash;must already be galloping his hardest towards
        the nearest telegraph wire, which, as like as not, is a hundred miles
        distant. He must "get there," by hook or by crook, in a minimum of
        time; and as soon as his message is on the wires, he must be hurrying
        back to the army, else he may chance to miss the great battle of the
        war. The correspondent must be most things to all men; he must have
        the sweet, angelic temper of a woman, be as affable as if he were
        running for office, and at the same time be big and ugly enough to
        impress the conviction that it would be extremely unwise to take any
        liberties with him.</p>

        <p>The career, no doubt, has some incidental drawbacks. No fewer than
        five British correspondents were killed in the recent campaigns in
        the Soudan. General Sherman threatened to hang all the correspondents
        found in his camp after a certain day, and General Sherman was the
        kind of man to fulfil any threat he made. I suppose there was no
        correspondent taking part in the Franco-German and Russo-Turkish wars
        who was not in custody over and over again on suspicion of being a
        spy. I have been a prisoner myself in France, Spain, Servia, Germany,
        Austria, Hungary, Russia, Roumania and Bulgaria; and I may perhaps
        venture to remark in passing that I cannot recommend any of these
        countries from this point of view. But the casual confinements, half
        irritating, half comic, to which he may be subjected, do not bother
        the war correspondent of the old world nearly as much as do the
        foreign languages which, if he is not a good linguist, hamper him
        every hour of every day. He really should possess the gift of
        tongues&mdash;be conversant with all European languages, a neat
        assortment of the Asiatic languages, and a few of the African
        tongues, such as Abyssinian, Ashantee, Zulu, and Soudanese. But how
        few in the nature of things can approximate this polyglot
        versatility. Often in Eastern Europe, and in Afghanistan, I have
        envied Messrs. Swinton, Smalley, Whitelaw Reed, and the other notable
        war correspondents of the American Civil War, in that they had not
        the difficulties of outlandish tongues to contend with. I own myself
        to be a poor linguist, and have many and many a time suffered for my
        dullness of what the Scotch call "up-take." It is true that I was
        fairly conversant with French and German, and could express my wants
        in Russian, Roumanian, Bulgarian, Spanish, Turkish, Hindustanee,
        Pushtoo, and Burmese, every word of which smatterings I have long
        since forgotten. But the truth is that the poorest peoples in the
        world in acquiring foreign languages are the English and the French;
        the readiest are the Russians and Americans. It was, after a fashion,
        a liberal education to listen to the fluency in some half-dozen
        languages of Poor McGahan, the "Ohio boy," who graduated from the
        plough to be perhaps the most brilliant war correspondent of modern
        times. His compatriot and colleague, Frank Millet, who has fallen
        away from glory as a war correspondent, and has taken to the inferior
        trade of painting, seemed to pick up a language by the mere accident
        of finding himself on the soil where it was spoken. In the first
        three days, after crossing the Danube into Bulgaria, Millet went
        about with book in hand, gathering in the names of things at which he
        pointed, and jotting down each acquisition in the book. On the fourth
        day he could swear in Bulgarian, copiously, fervently, and with a
        measure of intelligibility. Within a week he had conquered the
        uncouth tongue. As he voyaged lately down the Danube from source to
        mouth, charmingly describing the scenic panorama of the great river
        in the pages of <i>Harper</i>, those of you who have read those
        sketches will not have failed to notice how Millet talked to German,
        Hungarian, Servian, Bulgarian, Roumanian, and Turkish, each in his
        own tongue, those diverse languages having been acquired by him
        during the few months of the Russo-Turkish war.</p>

        <p>By this time, you may be wondering just where "Andreas" comes in.
        Perhaps I have been over long in getting to my specific subject; but
        I will not be discursive any more. It was at the <i>table d'hote</i>
        in the Serbische Krone Hotel, in Belgrade, where I first set eyes on
        Andreas. In the year 1876, Servia had thought proper to throw off the
        yoke of her Turkish suzerain, and to attempt to assert her
        independence by force of arms. But for very irregularly paid tribute
        she was virtually independent already, and probably in all Servia
        there were not two hundred Turks. But she ambitiously desired to have
        the name of as well as the actuality of being independent; the
        Russians helped her with arms, officers, and volunteer soldiers; and
        when I reached Belgrade, in May of the year named, there had already
        been fighting, in which the Servians had by no means got the worst.
        No word of the Servian tongue had I, and it was the reverse of
        pleasant for a war correspondent in such plight to learn that outside
        of Belgrade nobody, or at least hardly anybody, knew a word of any
        other language than the native Servian. As I ate, I was being
        attended by a very assiduous waiter, whose alertness and anxiety to
        please were very conspicuous. He was smart with quite un-Oriental
        smartness; he whisked about the tables with deftness; he spoke to me
        in German, to the Russian officers over against me in what I assumed
        was Russian, to the Servians dining behind me in what I took to be
        Servian. I liked the look of the man; there was intelligence in his
        aspect. One could not call him handsome, but there was character in
        the keen black eye, the high features and the pronounced chin,
        fringed on either side by bushy black whiskers.</p>

            "ANDREAS AS A FORAGER."</p>
        </div>

        <p>I had brought no servant with me; the average British servant is
        worse than useless in a foreign country, and the dubiously-polyglot
        courier is a snare and a deception on campaign. I had my eye on
        Andreas for a couple of days, during which he was of immense service
        to me. He seemed to know and stand well with everyone in Belgrade; it
        was he, indeed, who presented me in the restaurant to the Prime
        Minister and the Minister for War, who got together for me my field
        necessaries, who helped me to buy my horses, and who narrated to me
        the progress of the campaign so far as it had gone. On the third day
        I had him in my room and asked whether he would like to come with me
        into the field as my servant. He accepted the offer with effusion; we
        struck hands on the compact; he tendered me credentials which I
        ascertained to be extremely satisfactory; and then he gave me a
        little sketch of himself. It was somewhat mixed, as indeed was his
        origin. Primarily he was a Servian, but his maternal grandmother had
        been a Bosniak, an earlier ancestress had been in a Turkish harem,
        there was a strain in his blood of the Hungarian zinganee&mdash;the
        gipsy of Eastern Europe, and one could not look at his profile
        without a suspicion that there was a Jewish element in his pedigree.
        "A pure mongrel," was what a gentleman of the British Legation termed
        Andreas, and this self-contradictory epithet was scarcely out of
        place.</p>

        <p>Andreas turned out well. He was as hardy as a hill-goat, careless
        how and when he ate, or where he slept, which, indeed, was mostly in
        the open. It seemed to me that he had cousins all over Servia,
        chiefly of the female persuasion, and I am morally certain that the
        Turkish strain in his blood had in Andreas its natural development in
        a species of <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> polygamy. Sherman's prize
        "bummer" was not in it with Andreas as a forager. At first, indeed, I
        suspected him of actual plundering, so copiously did he bring in
        supplies, and so little had I to pay for them; but I was not long in
        discovering that all kinds of produce were dirt cheap in Servia, and
        that as I could myself buy a lamb for a quarter, it was not
        surprising that Andreas, to the manner born, could easily obtain one
        for half the money. He was an excellent horsemaster, and the stern
        vigour with which he chastised the occasional neglect of the cousin
        whom he had brought into my service as groom, was borne in upon me by
        the frequent howls which were audible from the rear of my tent. There
        was not a road in all Servia with whose every winding Andreas was not
        conversant, and this "extensive and peculiar" knowledge of his was
        often of great service to me. He was a light-weight and an excellent
        rider; I have sent him off to Belgrade with a telegram at dusk, and
        he was back again by breakfast time next morning, after a gallop of
        quite a hundred miles.</p>

        <p>No exertion fatigued him; I never saw the man out of humour; there
        was but one matter in regard to which I ever had to chide him, and in
        that I had perforce to let him have his own way, because I do not
        believe that he could restrain himself. He had served the term in the
        army which is, or was then, obligatory on all Servians; and on the
        road or in camp he was rather more of a "peace at any price" man than
        ever was the late Mr. John Bright himself. When the first fight
        occurred, Andreas claimed to be allowed to witness it along with me.
        I demurred; he might get hit; and if anything should happen to him,
        what should I do for a servant? At length I gave him the firm order
        to remain in camp, and started myself with the groom behind me on my
        second horse. The fighting occurred eight miles from camp, and in the
        course of it, leaving the groom in the rear, I had accompanied the
        Russian General Dochtouroff into a most unpleasantly hot place, where
        a storm of Turkish shells were falling in the effort to hinder the
        withdrawal of a disabled Servian battery. I happened to glance over
        my shoulder, and lo! Andreas on foot was at my horse's tail,
        obviously in a state of ecstatic enjoyment of the situation. I
        peremptorily ordered him back, and he departed sullenly, calmly
        strolling along the line of Turkish fire. Just then, Tchernaieff, the
        Servian Commander-in-Chief, had, it seemed, ordered a detachment of
        infantry to take in flank the Turkish guns. From where we stood I
        could discern the Servian soldiers hurrying forward close under the
        fringe of a wood near the line of retirement along which Andreas was
        sulking. Andreas saw them too, and retreated no step further, but cut
        across to them, snatching up a gun as he ran, and the last I saw of
        him was while he was waving on the militiamen with his billycock, and
        loosing off an occasional bullet, while he emitted yells of defiance
        against the Turks, which might well have struck terror into their
        very marrow. Andreas came into camp at night very streaky with powder
        stains, minus the lobe of one ear, uneasy as he caught my eye, yet
        with a certain elateness of mien. I sacked him that night, and he
        said he didn't care, and that he was not ashamed of himself. Next
        morning, as I was rising, he rushed into the tent, knelt down,
        clasped my knees, and bedewed my ankles with his tears. Of course I
        reinstated him; I couldn't do without him, and I think he knew
        it.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/056-1.jpg"><img src=

            "SNATCHING UP A GUN AS HE RAN."</p>
        </div>

        <p>But I had yielded too easily. Andreas had established a precedent.
        He insisted, in a quiet, positive manner, on accompanying me to every
        subsequent battle; and I had to consent, always taking his pledge
        that he would obey the injunctions I might lay upon him. And, as a
        matter of course, he punctually and invariably violated that pledge
        when the crisis of the fighting was drawing to a head, and just when
        this "peace at any price" man could not control the bloodthirst that
        was parching him.</p>

        <p>One never knows how events are to fall out. It happened that this
        resolution on the part of Andreas to accompany me into the fights
        once assuredly saved my life. It was on the day of Djunis, the last
        battle fought by the Servians. In the early part of the day there was
        a good deal of scattered woodland fighting in front of the entrenched
        line, which they abandoned when the Turks came on in earnest. Andreas
        and I were among the trees trying to find a position from which
        something was to be seen, when all of a sudden I, who was in advance,
        plumped right into the centre of a small scouting party of Turks.
        They tore me out of the saddle, and I had given myself up for
        lost&mdash;for the Turks took no prisoners, their cheerful practice
        being to slaughter first and then abominably to mutilate&mdash;when
        suddenly Andreas dashed in among my captors, shouting aloud in a
        language which I took to be Turkish, since he bellowed "Effendi" as
        he pointed to me. He had thrown away his billycock and substituted a
        fez, which he afterwards told me he always carried in case of
        accidents, and in one hand he waved a dingy piece of parchment with a
        seal dangling from it, which I assumed was some obsolete firman. The
        result was truly amazing, and the scene had some real humour in it.
        With profound salaams, the Turks unhanded me, helped me to mount,
        and, as I rode off at a tangent with Andreas at my horse's head,
        called after me what sounded like friendly farewells. When we were
        back among the Russians&mdash;I don't remember seeing much of the
        Servians later on that day&mdash;Andreas explained that he had passed
        himself for the Turkish dragoman of a British correspondent whom the
        Padishah delighted to honour, and that, after expressing a burning
        desire to defile the graves of their collective female ancestry, he
        had assured my captors that they might count themselves as dead men
        if they did not immediately release me. To his ready-witted conduct I
        undoubtedly owe the ability to write now this record of a man of
        curiously complicated nature.</p>

        <p>When the campaign ended with the Servian defeat at Djunis, Andreas
        went back to his headwaitership at the Serbische Krone in Belgrade.
        Before leaving that capital I had the honour of being present at his
        nuptials, a ceremony the amenity of which was somewhat disturbed by
        the violent incursion into the sacred edifice of sundry ladies all
        claiming to have prior claims on the bridegroom of the hour. They
        were, however, placated, and subsequently joined the marriage feast
        in the great arbour behind the Krone. Andreas faithfully promised to
        come to me to the ends of the earth on receipt of a telegram, if I
        should require his services, and he were alive.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/058-1.jpg"><img src=

            "ANDREAS DASHED IN AMONG MY CAPTORS."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Next spring the Russo-Turkish war broke out, and I hurried
        eastward in time to see the first Cossack cross the Pruth. I had
        telegraphed to Andreas from England to meet me at Bazias on the
        Danube below Belgrade. Bazias is the place where the railway used to
        end, and where we took steamer for the Lower Danube. Andreas was duly
        on hand, ready and serviceable as of old, a little fatter, and a
        trifle more consequential than when we had last parted. He was, if
        possible, rather more at home in Bucharest than he had been in
        Belgrade, and recommended me to Brofft's Hotel, in comparison with
        which the charges of the Brunswick in New York are infinitesimal. He
        bought my wagon and team, he found riding horses when they were said
        to be unprocurable, he constructed a most ingenious tent, of which
        the wagon was, so to speak, the roof-tree, he laid in stores,
        arranged for relays of couriers, and furnished me with a coachman in
        the person of a Roumanian Jew who he one day owned was a distant
        connection, and whose leading attribute was, that he could survive
        more sleep than any other human being I have ever known. We took the
        field auspiciously, Mr. Frederic Villiers, the war artist of the
        London <i>Graphic</i>, being my campaigning comrade. Thus early I
        discerned a slight rift in the lute. Andreas did not like Villiers,
        which showed his bad taste, or rather, perhaps, the narrowness of his
        capacity of affection; and I fear Villiers did not much like Andreas,
        whom he thought too familiar. This was true, and it was my fault; but
        really it was with difficulty that I could bring myself to treat
        Andreas as a servant. He was more, in my estimation, in the nature of
        the confidential major-domo, and to me he was simply invaluable.
        Villiers had to chew his moustache, and glower discontentedly at
        Andreas.</p>

        <p>I had some good couriers for the conveyance of despatches back
        across the Danube to Bucharest, whence everything was telegraphed to
        London; but they were essentially fair-weather men. The casual
        courier may be alert, loyal, and trustworthy; he may be relied on to
        try his honest best, but it is not to be expected of him that he will
        greatly dare and count his life but as dross when his incentive to
        enterprise is merely filthy lucre. But I could trust Andreas to dare
        and to endure&mdash;to overcome obstacles, and, if man could, to "get
        there," where, in the base-quarters in Bucharest, the amanuenses were
        waiting to copy out in round hand for the foreign telegraphist the
        rapid script of the correspondent scribbling for life in the saddle
        or the cleft of a commanding tree while the shells were whistling
        past. We missed him dreadfully when he was gone&mdash;even Villiers,
        who liked good cooking, owned to thinking long for his return. For,
        in addition to his other virtues, Andreas was a capital cook. It is
        true that his courses had a habit of arriving at long and uncertain
        intervals. After a dish of pungent stew, no other viands appearing to
        loom in the near future, Villiers and myself would betake ourselves
        to smoking, and perhaps on a quiet day would lapse into slumber. From
        this we would be aroused by Andreas to partake of a second course of
        roast chicken, the bird having been alive and unconscious of its
        impending fate when the first course had been served. No man is
        perfect, and as regarded Andreas there were some petty spots on the
        sun. He had, for instance, a mania for the purchase of irrelevant
        poultry, and for accommodating the fowls in our wagon, tied by the
        legs, against the day of starvation, which he always, but
        causelessly, apprehended. I do not suppose any reader has ever had
        any experience of domestic poultry as bedfellows, and I may caution
        him earnestly against making any such experiment.</p>

        <p>I do not know whether it is a detraction from Andreas's worth to
        mention that another characteristic of his was the habit of awaking
        us in the still watches of the night, for the purpose of imparting
        his views on recondite phases of the great Eastern question. But how
        trivial were such peccadilloes in a man who was so resolute not to be
        beaten in getting my despatch to the telegraph wire, that once, when
        three pontoons of the bridge across the Danube were sunk, he crossed
        the gap hand over hand by the hand-rope, sloshing down with the
        current as the slack of the rope gave to his weight! Andreas became
        quite an institution in the Russian camp. When Ignatieff, the Tsar's
        intimate, the great diplomatist who has now curiously fizzled out,
        would honour us by partaking sometimes of afternoon tea in our tent,
        he would call Andreas by his name and call him "Molodetz"&mdash;the
        Russian for "brave fellow." In the Servian campaign Dochtouroff had
        got him the Takova cross, which Andreas sported with great pride, and
        Ignatieff used to tell him that the Tsar was seriously thinking of
        conferring on him the Cross of St. George, badinage which Andreas
        took as dead earnest. MacGahan used gravely to entreat him to take
        greater care of his invaluable life, and hint that if any calamity
        occurred to him, the campaign would <i>ipso facto</i> come to an end.
        Andreas knew that MacGahan was quizzing him, but it was exceedingly
        droll how he purred and bridled under the light touch of that genial
        humourist, whose merits his own countrymen, to my thinking, have
        never adequately recognised. The old story of a prophet having scant
        honour in his own country.</p>

            "CROSSED THE GAP HAND OVER HAND."</p>
        </div>

        <p>After the long strain of the desperate but futile attack made by
        the Russians on Plevna in the early part of the September of the war,
        I fell a victim to the malarial fever of the Lower Danube, and had to
        be invalided back to Bucharest. The illness grew upon me, and my
        condition became very serious. Worthy Andreas nursed me with great
        tenderness and assiduity in the lodgings to which I had been brought,
        since they would not accept a fever patient at Brofft's. After some
        days of wretchedness I became delirious, and, of course, lost
        consciousness; my last recollection was of Andreas wetting my parched
        lips with lemonade. When I recovered my senses, and looked out
        feebly, there was nobody in the room. How long I had been unconscious
        I had no idea. I lay there in a half stupor till evening, unable from
        weakness to summon any assistance. In the dusk came the English
        doctor who had been attending me. "Where is Andreas?" he asked. I
        could not tell him. "He was here last night," he said; "you have been
        delirious for seven days." The woman of the house was summoned. She
        had not seen Andreas since the previous night, but, busy about her
        own domestic affairs, had no suspicion until she entered the room
        that Andreas was not with me still.</p>

        <p>Andreas never returned. It appeared that he had taken away all his
        belongings. One day, when gradually mending, I put my hand under the
        pillow with intent to find my watch, which was an heirloom, and wind
        it up. I could find no watch. No more could I find the bag of ducats
        which was alongside the watch before I lost my senses. Search was
        made throughout the room without success, and, with whatever
        reluctance to believe a thing so utterly unlikely, I could not
        refrain from the conviction that Andreas must have carried off both
        money and watch. The thought caused a relapse, but at length I
        attained convalescence, and was able to drive out. But the doctor was
        firm that during the now imminent winter I was not to return to the
        field. Fortunately, my able colleagues, MacGahan and Millet, were
        there; and I was therefore the less distressed by Dr.
        &mdash;&mdash;'s peremptory sentence on me. I was condemned to return
        to England as soon as I should be strong enough to travel.</p>

        <p>When I had to leave the Plevna front, my colleagues temporarily
        took charge of my field equipment. But I had brought back to
        Bucharest my best riding horse, and during my illness he had been
        standing at livery in the stables of the English Tramway Company.
        Determining now on the melancholy necessity of selling an animal
        which had on many a hard day and many a long night-ride served me
        staunchly, I drove to the stables, and instructed the manager to sell
        my horse. "Your horse!" he exclaimed, in evident surprise; "your
        horse was sold weeks ago! Your man, Andreas, came here with a message
        that we were to dispose of it; and I sold it next day to General
        Todleben on his way through Bucharest to take the command before
        Plevna. It fetched a good price, 105 ducats, more than you gave for
        it; Andreas called for the money, and, of course, I gave it to
        him."</p>

        <p>So Andreas was thief and rogue&mdash;deliberate thief and rogue. I
        was angry, but I was yet more heart-sorry that so fine and true a
        native should have thus fallen. Just as I was leaving Bucharest for
        England, a letter came to me from a friend in Galatz, a commercial
        city of Roumania, near the mouth of the Danube. Its P.S. only is
        worth quoting. "So you have parted with your man, Andreas. I thought
        from what you had told me that you would retain him for life. He is
        here now, I saw him drunk in the street yesterday. He told Kennedy
        that he believed you were dead."</p>

            "ANDREAS DROPPED ON HIS KNEES."</p>
        </div>

        <p>I went straight to Galatz, a long half-day's journey. Andreas was
        not hard to find; he was smoking in the "Concordia" saloon. I saw him
        before he saw me; he had a furtive air, he was pallid and his lips
        twitched; he looked to me on the verge of <i>delirium tremens</i>. I
        approached him from behind, and uttered the one word, "Andreas!" At
        the word, he started as if he had been shot, spun round, dropped on
        his knees, with his hands raised beseechingly, and cried in a broken
        voice, "Before God, master, I thought you were dead, else I should
        never have done it! I have not had a happy moment since I threw away
        my good name&mdash;I could not go home! Kill me, send me to prison,
        punish me how you choose. I shall rejoice to suffer!" And the poor
        wretch grovelled before me on his stomach.</p>

        <p>I had meant to punish him; but he was too broken for chastisement.
        I could not send to prison the man who had saved my life among the
        pine-trees of Djunis. I wonder if he really thought me dead&mdash;not
        that, if so, his act was thereby materially palliated. And I thought
        of two little sentences which my mother taught me when I was a child:
        "Judge not that ye be not judged," and "Lead us not into temptation."
        I pulled the man on to his feet and grasped his hand, then with the
        words, "Give me my father's watch&mdash;good-bye, Andreas. I shall
        remember all the good in you, and forget those last bad days." I
        turned from him, and quitted the "Concordia" with a lump in my throat
        that I could not swallow down.</p>
