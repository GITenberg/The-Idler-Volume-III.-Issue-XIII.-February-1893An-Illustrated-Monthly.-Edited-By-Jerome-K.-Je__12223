            MR. IRVING AS "DIGBY GRANT" IN "TWO ROSES."</p>
        </div>

        <p>The innumerable reviews of Mr. Irving by literary and artistic
        experts have left room enough for an amateur estimate by a man who is
        accustomed to regard human life mainly from a religious standpoint. A
        complete review of the Stage by the Pulpit could hardly be the work
        of a single pen; for my own part, therefore, I can only make a very
        small contribution to such a review by indicating a few points which
        have occurred to me in the study of one particular actor. At once,
        however, the question arises, Is Mr. Irving a man who can be thus
        summarily characterised? In a dramatic sense, are there not many Mr.
        Irvings? When a man can act "The Two Roses" and "The Dead Heart" with
        equal effect, when he can at will be as vulgar as <i>Robert
        Macaire</i>, or as dignified as <i>Cardinal Wolsey;</i> when he can
        be either as young as Hamlet or as old as Lear, the inquiry as to his
        plurality becomes natural and pertinent. For my part, I rank Mr.
        Irving the comedian above Mr. Irving the tragedian, just as I rank
        Nature above Art: each may be highest in its own way, yet the one may
        have a charm which the other cannot boast. Mr. Irving's tragedy
        sometimes requires working up, but his comedy is spontaneous and
        immediate. The needful working up of tragedy is no fault of the
        actor. Tragedy should hardly ever begin at once. The murder may come
        too soon. Premature rage is followed by untimely laughter. <i>Digby
        Grant</i> begins at once, and can be his best self in the very first
        sentence, but <i>Macbeth</i> must move towards his passion by
        finely-graded ascents. In Mr. Irving's exquisite representation,
        <i>Macbeth's</i> anxieties and perturbations, his rapid alternations
        of courage and cowardice, make delicate but obvious record of
        themselves in deepening the grey of his hair, and ploughing more
        deeply the lines of his face. A comedy may be judged scene by scene,
        almost sentence by sentence, but a tragedy can be truly estimated
        only when viewed in final perspective.</p>

            "A LITTLE CHEQUE." (MR. IRVING AS "DIGBY GRANT" IN "TWO
            ROSES.")</p>
        </div>

        <p>Judged by this test, I have no hesitation in regarding Mr.
        Irving's <i>King Lear</i> as the finest creation of his genius. This
        is an instance in which the actor creates the piece. Shakespeare is,
        as a poet and playwright, at his worst in "King Lear." Yet his
        accessories are wonderful in variety and suggestiveness. Only
        Shakespeare could have created the heath, and have so ordered the old
        King's passion, as to make his madness part of the very thunder and
        lightning. That was Shakespeare's magnificent conception, and Mr.
        Irving's rendering is worthy of its tempestuous grandeur. How to talk
        up to the storm, how to pierce the tumult with the cries of human
        distress, how to escape the ridiculous and the incongruous, how to be
        a King on the desolate heath, and to make the royalty gleam through
        the angry darkness, were the problems, and Mr. Irving solved them one
        and all, even with redundance of faculty and skill. At the end of the
        heath scene the man is more remembered than the storm. It has been
        objected that in the first scene Mr. Irving's <i>Lear</i> is too old
        and feeble. I venture to think otherwise. I further venture to think
        that the King's age and the King's imbecility have both been
        accurately appreciated. A man at eighty, a man athirst for flattery,
        a man who would pay a kingdom in exchange for adulation, must have
        outlived all that is best and strongest in human nature. He comes
        upon the stage as a wreck. His vanity has eaten up his sagacity, so
        that she, <i>Goneril</i> or <i>Regan</i>, who can flatter most, can
        lie most, and can play the devil best, shall fare most lavishly at
        his hands. Is it not well partly to excuse these excesses of
        self-valuation by such mitigations as can be found in the infirmity
        of old age? Even in an elderly man they would have been treated with
        contempt; they could only be endured in one whose eighty years had
        been doubled by the hardness of his life lot.</p>

        <p>In "Henry VIII." Mr. Irving had little to do. In that play the
        labour and the glory fell upon another, to the infinite delight of
        the public. In "Lear," Mr. Irving has everything to do. From
        beginning to end there is only one character. Even the fascinating
        <i>Cordelia</i> is but a silver cloud on the far horizon. "The King
        is coming" is the cry of the play. His madness is more, as to display
        and effect, than the sense of all the others. The scene is stiff and
        cold until his wild hair is observed to approach the front, and then
        the whole spectacle is alight with feeling and purpose. The other
        actors are not to blame that, to a large extent, they are thrown into
        the shade; indeed, they are to be warmly congratulated upon their
        self-suppression and their passive sympathy. It is a hard task to
        play the part of two heartless and treacherous daughters, and a
        pitiful fate to have to represent the villainy of <i>Edmund</i>, yet
        all this was admirably done. It cannot be an easy thing to come
        forward to play the villain well, for the better the dramatic villain
        is played the more is the actor compelled to recognise in his
        execration the exact degree of his success. So admirably can Mr.
        Irving himself play the villain, that it is difficult to believe that
        any godparents ever, on his unconscious behalf, renounced the pomps
        and vanities of this wicked world.</p>

        <p>In many minor parts&mdash;or along the subsidiary lines of great
        parts&mdash;Mr. Irving's subtlest power comes into effective play.
        Who, for example, can be more gentle or more graceful with a little
        child? Who could hug the "fool" more fondly than old <i>King
        Lear</i>? Then recall his wonderful recognitions of old friends.
        When, in "The Dead Heart," he is liberated from the Bastille, how old
        times slowly but surely dawn into consciousness, and how quickly the
        dawn hastens into the noontide of the tenderest fellowship and
        highest festival of joy. It is verily a resurrection. After eighteen
        years' entombment this political Lazarus comes forth to liberty, to
        leadership, to dominance.</p>

        <p>In "Lear," there are two wonderful instances of recognition, the
        recognition of <i>Gloster</i> and of <i>Cordelia</i>. <i>Gloster</i>
        is blind and bandaged. <i>Cordelia</i> has been long out of
        sight&mdash;if not in actual days yet in depth of feeling&mdash;and
        the King himself is demented. Little by little things shape
        themselves in the memory and fancy of the King. There is something
        confusedly familiar in the voice of <i>Gloster</i> which, tone by
        tone, settles into recognition. In the case of <i>Cordelia</i> the
        father gradually subdues the King, and instinct takes the place of
        reason; then, in a fine strain, comes the identification:</p>

        <table class="poetry">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not
                    laugh at me,<br />
                    For, as I am a man, I think this lady<br />
                    To be my child Cordelia."<br /></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The utterance of these words by Mr. Irving is simply thrilling.
        The tones, the glances, the approach, the embrace, lift up the words
        into new light, keen and tender as the brightness of a summer
        morning. The words themselves are by no means striking, are, indeed,
        the merest commonplace, but, uttered with the natural pathos of a
        consummate actor, they carry the play to its most subduing climax.
        The humanity and the genius satisfy expectation in its most eager and
        jealous temper. Failure at that point would have ruined the play.
        Which was better, <i>Lear</i> or <i>Cordelia</i>, in that critical
        action? We must first settle, Which is better, the star of morning or
        the morning star?</p>

            MR. IRVING AS "KING LEAR." (FROM THE LYCEUM SOUVENIR.)</p>
        </div>

        <p>As I opened this brief review with a reference to the religious
        standpoint, it may be well now to ask how the Church is to regard the
        Stage as an educational institution? The Stage cannot be put down. It
        responds to an instinct which is ineradicable, and which need not be
        ignoble. The parables of the New Testament are the sublimest
        recognition of that instinct. The drama is older than the theatre.
        Much of the greatest preaching has been dramatic, by which I mean
        that it has touched human life through the medium of story and
        parable, coloured and toned by a living fancy. Sometimes, too truly,
        the dramatic in preaching has degenerated into impossible anecdotes,
        most of them originating in the Far West of America, yet even such
        anecdotes testify to the overpowering force of the dramatic instincts
        when limited to their most vulgar conditions. My submission is, that
        a properly-conducted stage might be the most powerful ally of the
        pulpit. I advance upon this submission, and contend that the function
        of the preacher is infinitely superior to the function of the actor.
        Whatever the preacher has to say that is distinctive he can trace to
        what he believes to be a Divine and authoritative origin. I hold the
        great preacher to be a spiritual medium. In his next evolution he
        will simply tell the people whatever may have been given him in the
        same hour to say. This does not mean that indolence will supersede
        industry. Through the indolent man God sends no messages. The true
        prophet will always be preparing himself. By learning, by meditation,
        by self-discipline, the true prophet will prepare his heart for the
        incoming of the Eternal Spirit, and the glory of Heaven will be as a
        fire on the altar of the honest heart. Art preachers we have had in
        too great abundance. Mechanical talkers have brought upon the pulpit
        the disrepute of dulness. The age now waits for the messenger in
        whose loving heart there is the glow and the radiance of divinest
        sympathy. The great actor himself would be the first to admit that
        the preacher cannot trace his own public secondariness to the poverty
        of his themes. Where the preacher falls behind the actor, it is
        because the preacher does not realise the majesty and the tenderness,
        the vehemence and the urgency, of his own message.</p>
