        <h3>THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT.</h3>

        <h3>BY MISS M. E. BRADDON.</h3>

        <h4>ILLUSTRATIONS BY MISS F. L. FULLER.</h4>

        <p>My first novel! Far back in the distinctness of childish memories
        I see a little girl who has lately learnt to write, who has lately
        been given a beautiful brand new mahogany desk, with a red velvet
        slope, and a glass ink bottle, such a desk as might now be bought for
        three and sixpence, but which in the forties cost at least
        half-a-guinea. Very proud is the little girl, with the Kenwigs
        pigtails, and the Kenwigs frills, of that mahogany desk, and its
        infinite capacities for literary labour, above all, gem of gems, its
        stick of variegated sealing-wax, brown, speckled with gold, and its
        little glass seal with an intaglio representing two
        doves&mdash;Pliny's doves perhaps, famous in mosaic, only the little
        girl had never heard of Pliny, or his Laurentine Villa.</p>

        LICHFIELD HOUSE, RICHMOND.</p>

        <p>Armed with that desk and its supply of stationery, Mary Elizabeth
        Braddon&mdash;very fond of writing her name at full-length, and her
        address also at full-length, though the word "Middlesex" offered
        difficulties&mdash;began that pilgrimage on the broad high road of
        fiction, which was destined to be a longish one. So much for the
        little girl of eight years old, in the third person, and now to
        become strictly autobiographical.</p>

        <p>My first story was based on those fairy tales which first opened
        to me the world of imaginative literature. My first attempt in
        fiction, and in round-hand, on carefully pencilled double lines, was
        a story of two sisters, a good sister and a wicked, and I fear
        adhered more faithfully to the lines of the archetypal story than the
        writer's pen kept to the double fence which should have ensured
        neatness.</p>

            THE STAIRCASE.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The interval between the ages of eight and twelve was a prolific
        period, fertile in unfinished MSS., among which I can now trace a
        historical novel on the Siege of Calais&mdash;an Eastern story,
        suggested by a passionate love of Miss Pardoe's Turkish tales, and
        Byron's "Bride of Abydos," which my mother, a devoted Byron
        worshipper, allowed me to read aloud to her&mdash;and doubtless
        murder in the reading&mdash;a story of the Hartz Mountains, with
        audacious flights in German diablerie; and lastly, very seriously
        undertaken, and very perseveringly worked upon, a domestic story, the
        outline of which was suggested by the same dear and sympathetic
        mother.</p>

        <p>Now it is a curious fact, which may or may not be common to other
        story-spinners, that I have never been able to take kindly to a
        plot&mdash;or the suggestion of a plot&mdash;offered to me by anybody
        else. The moment a friend tells me that he or she is desirous of
        imparting a series of facts&mdash;strictly true&mdash;as if truth in
        fiction mattered one jot!&mdash;which in his or her opinion would
        make the ground plan of an admirable, startling, and altogether
        original three-volume novel, I know in advance that my imagination
        will never grapple with those startling circumstances&mdash;that my
        thoughts will begin to wander before my friend has got half through
        the remarkable chain of events, and that if the obliging purveyor of
        romantic incidents were to examine me at the end of the story, I
        should be spun ignominiously. For the most part, such subjects as
        have been proposed to me by friends have been hopelessly unfit for
        the circulating library; or, where not immoral, have been utterly
        dull; but it is, I believe, a fixed idea in the novel-reader's mind
        that any combination of events out of the beaten way of life will
        make an admirable subject for the novelist's art.</p>

        <p>My dear mother, taking into consideration my tender years, and
        perhaps influenced in somewise by her own love of picking up odd bits
        of Sheraton or Chippendale furniture in the storehouses of the less
        ambitious second-hand dealers of those simpler days, offered me the
        following <i>scenario</i> for a domestic story. It was an incident
        which, I doubt not, she had often read at the tail of a newspaper
        column, and which certainly savours of the gigantic gooseberry, the
        sea-serpent, and the agricultural labourer who unexpectedly inherits
        half-a-million. It was eminently a Simple Story, and far more worthy
        of that title than Mrs. Inchbald's long and involved romance.</p>

        <p>An honest couple, in humble circumstances, possess among their
        small household gear a good old easy chair, which has been the pride
        of a former generation, and is the choicest of their household gods.
        A comfortable cushioned chair, snug and restful, albeit the chintz
        covering, though clean and tidy, as virtuous people's furniture
        always is in fiction, is worn thin by long service, while the dear
        chair itself is no longer the chair it once was as to legs and
        framework.</p>

        <p>Evil days come upon the praiseworthy couple and their dependent
        brood, among whom I faintly remember the love interest of the story
        to have lain; and that direful day arrives when the average landlord
        of juvenile fiction, whose heart is of adamant and brain of brass,
        distrains for the rent. The rude broker swoops upon the humble
        dovecot; a cart or hand-barrow waits on the carefully hearth-stoned
        door-step for the household gods; the family gather round the
        cherished chair, on which the rude broker has already laid his grimy
        fingers; they hang over the back and fondle the padded arms; and the
        old grandmother, with clasped hands, entreats that, if able to raise
        the money in a few days, they may be allowed to buy back that loved
        heirloom.</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/025-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/025-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            THE DINING ROOM.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The broker laughs the plea to scorn; they might have their chair,
        and cheap enough, he had no doubt. The cover was darned and
        patched&mdash;as only the virtuous poor of fiction do darn and do
        patch&mdash;and he made no doubt the stuffing was nothing better than
        brown wool; and with that coarse taunt the coarser broker dug his
        clasp-knife into the cushion against which grandfatherly backs had
        leaned in happier days, and lo! an avalanche of banknotes fell out of
        the much-maligned horse-hair, and the family was lifted from penury
        to wealth. Nothing more simple&mdash;or more natural. A prudent but
        eccentric ancestor had chosen this mode of putting by his savings,
        assured that, whenever discovered, the money would be useful
        to&mdash;somebody.</p>

        <p>So ran the <i>scenario</i>: but I fancy my juvenile pen hardly
        held on to the climax. My brief experience of boarding school
        occurred at this time, and I well remember writing "The Old Arm
        Chair" in a penny account book, in the schoolroom of Cresswell Lodge,
        and that I was both surprised and offended at the laughter of the
        kindly music-teacher who, coming into the room to summon a pupil, and
        seeing me gravely occupied, enquired what I was doing, and was
        intensely amused at my stolid method of composition, plodding on
        undisturbed by the voices and occupations of the older girls around
        me. "The Old Arm Chair" was certainly my first serious, painstaking
        effort in fiction; but as it was abandoned unfinished before my
        eleventh birthday, and as no line thereof ever achieved the
        distinction of type, it can hardly rank as my first novel.</p>

        <p class="figure"><a href="images/026-1.jpg"><img src=
        "images/026-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
        THE DRAWING-ROOM.</p>

        <p>There came a very few years later the sentimental period, in which
        my unfinished novels assumed a more ambitious form, and were modelled
        chiefly upon Jane Eyre, with occasional tentative imitations of
        Thackeray. Stories of gentle hearts that loved in vain, always ending
        in renunciation. One romance there was, I well remember, begun with
        resolute purpose, after the first reading of Esmond, and in the
        endeavour to give life and local colour to a story of the Restoration
        period, a brilliantly wicked interval in the social history of
        England, which, after the lapse of thirty years, I am still as bent
        upon taking for the background of a love story as I was when I began
        "Master Anthony's Record" in Esmondese, and made my girlish
        acquaintance with the Reading-room of the British Museum, where I
        went in quest of local colour, and where much kindness was shown to
        my youth and inexperience of the book world. Poring over a folio
        edition of the State Trials at my uncle's quiet rectory in sleepy
        Sandwich, I had discovered the passionate romantic story of Lord
        Grey's elopement with his sister-in-law, next in sequence to the
        trial of Lawrence Braddon and Hugh Speke for conspiracy. At the risk
        of seeming disloyal to my own race, I must add that it seemed to me a
        very tinpot order of plot to which these two learned gentlemen bent
        their legal minds, and which cost the Braddon family a heavy fine in
        land near Camelford&mdash;confiscation which I have heard my father
        complain of as especially unfair&mdash;Lawrence being a younger son.
        The romantic story of Lord Grey was to be the subject of "Master
        Anthony's Record," but Master Anthony's sentimental autobiography
        went the way of all my earlier efforts. It was but a year or so after
        the collapse of Master Anthony, that a blindly-enterprising printer
        of Beverley, who had seen my poor little verses in the <i>Beverley
        Recorder</i>, made me the spirited offer of ten pounds for a serial
        story, to be set up and printed at Beverley, and published on
        commission by a London firm in Warwick Lane. I cannot picture to
        myself, in my after-knowledge of the bookselling trade, any
        enterprise more futile in its inception or more feeble in its
        execution; but to my youthful ambition the actual commission to write
        a novel, with an advance payment of fifty shillings to show good
        faith on the part of my Yorkshire speculator, seemed like the opening
        of that pen-and-ink paradise which I had sighed for ever since I
        could hold a pen. I had, previously to this date, found a
        M&aelig;cenas in Beverley, in the person of a learned gentleman who
        volunteered to foster my love of the Muses by buying the copyright of
        a volume of poems and publishing the same at his own
        expense&mdash;which he did, poor man, without stint, and by which
        noble patronage of Poet's Corner verse, he must have lost money. He
        had, however, the privilege of dictating the subject of the principal
        poem, which was to sing&mdash;however feebly&mdash;Garibaldi's
        Sicilian campaign.</p>

            THE SMOKING-ROOM.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Beverley printer suggested that my Warwick Lane serial should
        combine, as far as my powers allowed, the human interest and genial
        humour of Dickens with the plot-weaving of G. W. R. Reynolds; and,
        furnished with these broad instructions, I filled my ink bottle,
        spread out my foolscap, and, on a hopelessly wet afternoon, began my
        first novel&mdash;now known as "The Trail of the Serpent"&mdash;but
        published in Warwick Lane, and later in the stirring High Street of
        Beverley, as "Three Times Dead." In "Three Times Dead" I gave loose
        to all my leanings to the violent in melodrama. Death stalked in
        ghastliest form across my pages; and villainy reigned triumphant till
        the Nemesis of the last chapter. I wrote with all the freedom of one
        who feared not the face of a critic; and, indeed, thanks to the
        obscurity of its original production, and its re-issue as the
        ordinary two-shilling railway novel, this first novel of mine has
        almost entirely escaped the critical lash, and has pursued its way as
        a chartered libertine. People buy it and read it, and its faults and
        follies are forgiven as the exuberances of a pen unchastened by
        experience; but faster and more facile at that initial stage than it
        ever became after long practice.</p>

        <p>I dashed headlong at my work, conjured up my images of horror or
        of mirth, and boldly built the framework of my story, and set my
        puppets moving. To me, at least, they were living creatures, who
        seemed to follow impulses of their own, to be impelled by their own
        passions, to love and hate, and plot and scheme of their own accord.
        There was unalloyed pleasure in the composition of that first story,
        and the knowledge that it was to be actually printed and published,
        and not to be declined with thanks by adamantine magazine editors,
        like a certain short story which I had lately written, and which
        contained the germ of "Lady Audley's Secret." Indeed, at this period
        of my life, the postman's knock had become associated in my mind with
        the sharp sound of a rejected MS. dropping through the open
        letter-box on to the floor of the hall, while my heart seemed to drop
        in sympathy with that book-post packet.</p>

        "" /></a><br />
        THE LIBRARY.</p>

        <p>Short of never being printed at all, my Beverley-born novel could
        have hardly entered upon the world of books in a more profound
        obscurity. That one living creature ever bought a number of "Three
        Times Dead" I greatly doubt. I can recall the thrill of emotion with
        which I tore open the envelope that contained my complimentary copy
        of the first number, folded across, and in aspect inferior to a
        gratis pamphlet about a patent medicine. The miserable little wood
        block which illustrated that first number would have disgraced a
        baker's whitey-brown bag, would have been unworthy to illustrate a
        penny bun. My spirits were certainly dashed at the technical
        shortcomings of that first serial, and I was hardly surprised when I
        was informed a few weeks later, that although my admirers at Beverley
        were deeply interested in the story, it was not a financial success,
        and that it would be only obliging on my part, and in accordance with
        my known kindness of heart, if I were to restrict the development of
        the romance to half its intended length, and to accept five pounds in
        lieu of ten as my reward. Having no desire that the rash Beverley
        printer should squander his own or his children's fortune in the
        obscurity of Warwick Lane, I immediately acceded to his request,
        shortened sail, and went on with my story, perhaps with a shade less
        enthusiasm, having seen the shabby figure it was to make in the book
        world. I may add that the Beverley publisher's payments began and
        ended with his noble advance of fifty shillings. The balance was
        never paid; and it was rather hard lines that, on his becoming
        bankrupt in his poor little way a few years later, a judge in the
        Bankruptcy Court remarked that, as Miss Braddon was now making a good
        deal of money by her pen, she ought to "come to the relief" of her
        first publisher.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:40%; clear:both;">

            MISS BRADDON'S FAVOURITE MARE.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And now my volume of verses being well under weigh, I went with my
        mother to farm-house lodgings in the neighbourhood of that very
        Beverley, where I spent, perhaps, the happiest half-year of my
        life&mdash;half a year of tranquil, studious days, far from the
        madding crowd, with the mother whose society was always all
        sufficient for me&mdash;half a year among level pastures, with
        unlimited books from the library in Hull, an old farm-horse to ride
        about the green lanes, the breath of summer, with all its sweet
        odours of flower and herb, around and about us: half a year of
        unalloyed bliss, had it not been for one dark shadow, the heroic
        figure of Garibaldi, the sailor soldier, looming large upon the
        foreground of my literary labours, as the hero of a lengthy narrative
        poem in the Spenserian metre.</p>

        <p>My chief business at Beverley was to complete the volume of verse
        commissioned by my Yorkshire M&aelig;cenas, at that time a very rich
        man, who paid me a much better price for my literary work than his
        townsman, the enterprising printer, and who had the first claim on my
        thought and time.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/031-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/031-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            THE ORANGERY.</p>
        </div>

        <p>With the business-like punctuality of a salaried clerk, I went
        every morning to my file of the <i>Times</i>, and pored and puzzled
        over Neapolitan revolution and Sicilian campaign, and I can only say
        that if Emile Zola has suffered as much over Sedan as I suffered in
        the freshness of my youth, when flowery meadows and the old chestnut
        mare invited to summer idlesse, over the fighting in Sicily, his
        dogged perseverance in uncongenial labour should place him among the
        Immortal Forty. How I hated the great Joseph G. and the Spenserian
        metre, with its exacting demands upon the rhyming faculty. How I
        hated my own ignorance of modern Italian history, and my own eyes for
        never having looked upon Italian landscape, whereby historical
        allusion and local colour were both wanting to that dry-as-dust
        record of heroic endeavour. I had only the <i>Times</i>
        correspondent; where he was picturesque I could be
        picturesque&mdash;allowing always for the Spenserian
        straining&mdash;where he was rich in local colour I did my utmost to
        reproduce his colouring, stretched always on the Spenserian rack, and
        lengthened out by the bitter necessity of finding triple rhymes. Next
        to Guiseppe Garibaldi I hated Edmund Spenser, and it may be from a
        vengeful remembrance of those early struggles with a difficult form
        of versification, that, although throughout my literary life I have
        been a lover of England's earlier poet, and have delighted in the
        quaintness and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of Chaucer, I have
        refrained from reading more than a casual stanza or two of the
        "Fa&euml;ry Queen." When I lived at Beverley, Spenser was to me but a
        name, and Byron's "Childe Harold" was my only model for that exacting
        verse. I should add that the Beverley M&aelig;cenas, when
        commissioning this volume of verse, was less superb in his ideas than
        the literary patron of the past. He looked at the matter from a
        purely commercial standpoint, and believed that a volume of verse,
        such as I could produce, would pay&mdash;a delusion on his part which
        I honestly strove to combat before accepting his handsome offer of
        remuneration for my time and labour. It was with this idea in his
        mind that he chose and insisted upon the Sicilian Campaign as a
        subject for my muse, and thus started me heavily handicapped on the
        racecourse of Parnassus.</p>

        MISS BRADDON'S COTTAGE AT LYNDHURST.</p>

        <p>The weekly number of "Three Times Dead" was "thrown off" in brief
        intervals of rest from my <i>magnum opus</i>, and it was an infinite
        relief to turn from Garibaldi and his brothers in arms to the angels
        and the monsters which my own brain had engendered, and which to me
        seemed more alive than the good great man whose arms I so laboriously
        sang. My rustic pipe far better loved to sing of melodramatic
        poisoners and ubiquitous detectives; of fine houses in the West of
        London, and dark dens in the East. So the weekly chapter of my first
        novel ran merrily off my pen while the printer's boy waited in the
        farm-house kitchen.</p>

        <p>Happy, happy days, so near to memory, and yet so far. In that
        peaceful summer I finished my first novel, knocked Garibaldi on the
        head with a closing rhapsody, saw the York spring and summer races in
        hopelessly wet weather, learnt to love the Yorkshire people, and left
        Yorkshire almost broken-heartedly on a dull gray October morning, to
        travel Londonwards through a landscape that was mostly under
        water.</p>

        <p>And, behold, since that October morning I have written fifty-three
        novels; I have lost dear old friends and found new friends, who are
        also dear, but I have never looked on a Yorkshire landscape since I
        turned my reluctant eyes from those level meadows and green lanes
        where the old chestnut mare used to carry me ploddingly to and fro
        between tall, tangled hedges of eglantine and honeysuckle.</p>
