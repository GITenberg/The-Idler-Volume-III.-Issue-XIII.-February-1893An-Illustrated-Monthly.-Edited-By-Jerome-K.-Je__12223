        MR. GEORGE GROSSMITH.</p>

        <p>A little, slight man, with a thin, clever, mobile, clean-shaven
        face, a sharp inquisitive nose surmounted by a perpetual pair of
        <i>pince-nez</i>, and a rather sarcastic mouth, from which wit and
        humour as light and airy as the cigarette smoke which accompanied
        each remark continually flowed.</p>

        <p>Mr. George Grossmith, the well-known actor and society clown.</p>

        <p>He stands on the hearthrug of his own special sanctum in his
        handsome house in Dorset Square, with his back to the fire, cigarette
        in his mouth, his hands now in his pockets, now waving in the air, as
        he vivaciously tells me the story of his busy, energetic and
        wonderfully interesting life.</p>

            MRS. GEORGE GROSSMITH.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"I was born," said he, "in 1847. I come of a family of actors and
        reciters. My father, whose portrait you see there on the wall, was a
        well-known lecturer and entertainer. Sixty or seventy years ago my
        uncle created a great sensation as a child actor, and he was commonly
        known as the 'celebrated infant Roscius.' Come out into the hall,"
        continued the lively little entertainer, "and I will show you some
        old engravings which represent him in his favourite characters. Then
        my brother Weedon, as you know, is, of course, a well-known actor, as
        well as a clever artist, and part author with myself of several
        sketches which have appeared in <i>Punch</i>. My eldest son now
        begins to display the family tendency to a most alarming extent. For
        my own part, I started my career as a reporter at Bow Street Police
        Court, a training which I have found invaluable in many respects ever
        since. My subsequent history as actor and society clown is so well
        known that I need not trouble you with it any further."</p>

        <p>"I suppose you find the taste of your audiences has gone up
        considerably within the last twenty years, do you not?"</p>

        <p>"Why, yes," he replied. "They wouldn't stand to-day what they used
        to roar at then. My music is quite elaborate compared with the two or
        three chords which easily satisfied people in the sixties and early
        seventies. Listen to this," continued my host, as he sat down to the
        <i>piano</i> and struck a couple of very simple chords. Then he
        glided softly into what he termed a modern accompaniment. It was all
        the difference between "Ten Little Niggers" and a slumber song of
        Schubert.</p>

            MR. GROSSMITH'S HOUSE.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"And do you find the public very critical?"</p>

        <p>"Well," he replied, with a smile, "they are very kind. It is your
        professional critic who is severe, though I can honestly say they
        invariably treat me well. Criticism up to a certain point is good
        enough. Beyond that point it is absolutely disabling to me. My father
        was a very severe critic. When we went out together he used to take
        the first half-hour, and then go to the back of the hall and
        criticise me. But it so hampered me by causing me to think of and
        consider every pose that I had to beg of him to desist. And then
        again, as regards criticism, I always think&mdash;it may be very
        conceited on my part&mdash;that I know a great deal more what the
        public want than my critics do. I declare to you I should have to
        take everything out of my sketches if I attempted to carry out all
        the suggestions that are made to me. I can absolutely feel the public
        pulse after so many years upon the platform. I am almost always
        right. When I first started 'See me Dance the Polka' it fell quite
        flat. I gave it up, although I felt sure it ought to go. The public
        then demanded it, and it went with a swing. The public had changed
        its mind. Not I."</p>

            <p class="figure"><a href="images/074-1.jpg"><img src=

            THE DINING ROOM.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"And how do you prepare your sketches?" said I, as Mr. Grossmith
        lit another cigarette, and took up his position on the hearthrug
        again.</p>

        <p>"Anyhow and anywhere the idea comes to me for a sketch. I am
        seated in a railway train, and I think of a sea-side sketch. I close
        my eyes and try to recall every single feature of interest on a
        crowded fashionable beach in the height of the season. Nothing is too
        unimportant. The way in which an old lady settles herself comfortably
        into her chair, the manner in which a man, especially a shy man,
        walks into the room, all these things, slightly exaggerated, but
        still true to nature, are immensely appreciated. First I have the
        idea, then I elaborate, sometimes for months, then I produce on the
        stage, and the people say, 'How remarkable it is you should invent
        all this on the spur of the moment!' That, of course, is a great
        compliment. The song-writing is always amusing," continued Mr.
        Grossmith, as he placed in my hand a little notebook in which were
        suggestions and elaborations innumerable. One thing I noticed, which
        he himself had condemned, but which was decidedly amusing, although
        it has never been allowed to see the light of day:</p>

        <p class="figure" style="clear:both;"><a href=
        "images/075-1.jpg"><img src="images/075-1.jpg" width="100%" alt=
        "" /></a><br />
        THE DRAWING-ROOM.</p>

        <table class="poetry">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>"I've been engaged to many,<br />
                    Quite a score of times at least;<br />
                    I don't think I with safety <i>can say</i><br />
                    Where I met my first <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.<br />
                    Oh! 'tis better to have loved and lost<br />
                    Than never to have loved at all;<br />
                    So I may say I have loved and <i>lost a lot</i>,<br />
                    And my fickleness has <i>cost a lot</i>."<br /></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Grossmith, as he leaned over me and saw what I was
        reading; "my better judgment told me that was not good enough for the
        public."</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:20%; clear:both;">

            "I LOSE ALL PATIENCE."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Then came a pencilled note in this little book, "You can take a
        horse to water, but can't make him drink." "That gave me an idea,"
        cried Mr. Grossmith, as he sprang to his feet. "You can take a boy to
        the piano, but you can't make him play.' Thought I to myself, that
        would make a capital sketch. And here is how I set about it,"
        continued he, as he proceeded to illustrate his remarks. "Imagine a
        little fellow in the corner there. I then begin in dumb show to
        encourage him to come to the piano. 'Come on, my boy; you know you
        can play that pretty piece you played yesterday. Come on, there's a
        good fellow!' Wonderful what you can do with persuasion! He refuses.
        I attempt to lead him to the piano. He won't budge an inch. I carry
        him under my arm and seat him in front of the instrument, the
        audience roaring all the time. At last his mistakes are so many and
        so ridiculous, I lose all patience and catch him a mighty box upon
        the ears! Tableau!! Of course there is no boy on the platform at all,
        I am quite alone, but I have so thoroughly lost myself in my
        imagination that people have declared years after, 'Oh! but I am
        quite sure you had a boy with you; why, don't you remember how you
        boxed his ears?'"</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:30%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/077-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/077-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "HOW I DO IRVING."</p>
        </div>

        <p>No less marvellous than his power of acting is his power of
        mimicry. "I will show you how I do Irving," said he, and in a moment
        the little man had ruffled his hair, had assumed to the life not only
        Irving's peculiar gait, but, even more remarkable still, had managed
        to secure almost exactly the very expression of the great tragedian's
        face.</p>

        <p>"Then again, I find it a good idea to take up some craze or topic
        of the moment. 'The Drama on Crutches' I wrote when the craze first
        arose amongst the aristocracy for going on the stage. One of the
        sketches which you will find outlined in that little notebook is
        entitled, 'Is Music a Failure?' and I endeavoured to answer the
        question by showing how popular it is among all classes of the
        community." I will quote pretty freely from this outlined sketch, as
        it will give my readers an idea, better than anything else would do,
        of the manner in which Mr. Grossmith prepares his delightful
        sketches.</p>

        <p>"I am not going to treat the subject seriously," he writes, "but
        in my own particular, impertinent way. The question often
        arises&mdash;are we a musical nation? The foreigners think we are
        not. But where in the wide, wide world is there a country where you
        will hear so many organs and German bands? Where is the country,
        excepting ours, that can appreciate the concertina? Where, except in
        England, can you hear that delightful combination of harp and cornet
        outside a house of refreshment? The prejudice of other nations is
        distressing; and as for their ignorance, why, I don't suppose Italy
        and Germany have even heard of the ocarino and the Jew's harp."</p>

        <p>And so the sketch runs on, until, in speaking of the universal
        manner in which music is appreciated in England by all classes, Mr.
        Grossmith goes on to say: "We have made rapid strides, so have our
        servants. They don't know how to dust the piano, but they can play
        it. Everybody plays the piano, from the Peerage to the School Board.
        Then look how music has crept into our homes and social circles.
        Besides the piano, the mother and daughters play the banjo, the son
        plays the first fiddle, and the father the second fiddle&mdash;as
        usual. I know of a Lord Mayor who plays the trombone, a clergyman who
        plays the big drum&mdash;that's a nice unpretentious, giddy
        instrument!&mdash;and I know of any number of members of Parliament
        who blow their own trumpets!!" And so the notes go brightly on
        through many pages.</p>

        <div style="clear:both;">
            &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p>"This," explained my host, "is a fair specimen of the method I
        employ in preparing a drawing-room sketch. As a rule, my audiences of
        that class are capital. I always love a well-dressed audience, it is
        so cheerful. You mayn't perhaps get as much applause as you do from
        the sixpenny gallery, but then applause often spoils your point.
        Once, however, I remember singing at a private house in the country
        to an odd assortment of people. I was informed that the party
        followed a wedding which had taken place in the morning. If it had
        followed a funeral it could not have been more gloomy and depressed
        than it was. I played the piano and the fool for three-quarters of an
        hour, and anything more dismal than the result it would be impossible
        to conceive. A temptation seized me suddenly, and I said: 'Ladies and
        gentlemen,&mdash;I am going to reveal to you a secret. Pray don't let
        it go any further. This is supposed to be a comic entertainment. I
        don't expect you to laugh at it in the least; but if, during the next
        sketch, you would only once oblige me with a society smile, it would
        give me a great deal of encouragement.' The audience for a moment
        were dumbfounded. They first began to titter, then to laugh, and
        actually to roar, and for a time I could not proceed with the sketch.
        They were transformed into a capital and enthusiastic audience, and
        the hostess told me that both her guests and herself were most
        grateful to me. I am sometimes amused with the little eccentricities
        of people who wish to secure my services for their parties. A
        gentleman once wrote to me to entertain some friends of his, and,
        added he, 'I trust that your sketches are strictly <i>comme il
        faut</i>, as I have several young daughters.' I was so immensely
        tickled by this that, rightly or wrongly, I replied that my
        entertainments <i>were</i> as they should be, for I was recently
        married, and hoped myself to have several young daughters. He wrote
        thanking me for this assurance, and I was to consider myself
        accordingly engaged. There is a story I tell in my book which will
        bear repetition: A young gentleman once called upon me. He explained
        that he was acting as a sort of ambassador for a friend of his, Mrs.
        &mdash;&mdash;, of Mayfair, who wished me to dine at her house. I
        replied that I had not the honour of the lady's acquaintance, and,
        though appreciating her kind invitation, I did not see how I could
        very well avail myself of it. He said that Prince Somebody or other
        and La Comtesse de So-and-so would be dining there, and Mrs.
        &mdash;&mdash; would be so pleased if I would join the party, and
        sing a little song after dinner. 'Oh,' I said, 'if Mrs.
        &mdash;&mdash; wishes to engage me professionally, that is another
        matter, and if I am at liberty, I will come with much pleasure.'
        'Well,' said the ambassador, 'I fancy Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is under
        the impression that if she includes you in her dinner party it is an
        understood thing that you sing afterwards.' 'I am afraid I do not
        understand that,' I said. 'It would not pay me to do so. I only
        consume about ten shillings worth of food and wine, and my terms are
        more than that.' There," said Mr. Grossmith, "could you have believed
        that anyone would have been so inconceivably mean and caddish?"</p>

        <p>"I have had some curious experiences on tour," he went on. "That
        is hard work, if you like. I have gone a four months' tour without
        missing a night. It takes it out of one terribly. But it is very
        paying work. In the South of England I have made as much as
        &pound;300 a week. My friends tried to frighten me as to the apathy
        of my Scotch audiences; as a matter of fact, I have no better
        audiences anywhere. I like performing to country audiences. I am
        never nervous as I am apt to be at St. James's, where there are a
        number of my friends. And it is on my country tours that I have many
        curious experiences. Amateurs invariably call at the hotel to see me,
        and to ask my advice as to their powers of recitation. Some are quite
        hopeless, and I haven't the heart to condemn them utterly, or to go
        beyond 'I tell you quite candidly, since you ask me, that I have
        heard better.' As a rule they are very quiet and modest, but now and
        again one encounters some fearful specimens. I remember once at a
        country town, which we will call Mudborough, a flashy young cad, in a
        very loud suit, called to see me with a parcel under his arm. He had
        come, he told me, to learn my opinion of his singing. He further
        informed me that he was known as 'the Mudborough Grossmith.' He
        didn't have the courtesy to take off his hat; he walked up and down
        my room, whistling, singing, and handing me over now and again
        specimens of his powers as a water-colour painter. I looked at them.
        At last, tired of the idiot and his airs, I said, 'I hope your
        musical sketches are better than you water-colour sketches.' Nothing,
        however, could snub this fellow. He proceeded straightway to sing me
        an improved version of 'See me Dance the Polka.' 'Do your audience
        like it?' I asked. 'I should think they did,' he replied; 'I will let
        you have that last verse if you like.' I thanked him sarcastically,
        and at last he withdrew. I have, however, come across some real
        talent in this way. For instance, that admirable actor and
        entertainer, Eric Lewis, is a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of mine,
        and you could not have a better man than he. Another amusing incident
        occurred at Southsea. My secretary was in a shop one day, and he
        overheard three ladies discussing the respective merits of Corney
        Grain and myself. Two of them were for Corney Grain and one was for
        me. Finding at last that the odds were too strong for her, she
        departed with this final shot: 'Well, never mind, Mr. Corney Grain
        can't jump on to a piano,' referring to my imitation of Minnie
        Palmer."</p>

        <p>Replying to a question I put to him as to his theatrical
        experiences, Mr. Grossmith told me that it was in the November of
        1877 that he received the following letter:&mdash;</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Beefsteak Club,</p>

            <p>"King William Street,</p>

            <p>"Tuesday Night.</p>

            <p>"Dear Mr. Grossmith,&mdash;Are you inclined to go on the stage
            for a time? There is a part in the new piece I am doing with
            Gilbert which I think you would play admirably. I can't find a
            good man for it. Let me have a line, or come to Albert Mansions
            to-morrow, after 4; or Thursday, before 2.30.</p>

            <p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

            <p>"ARTHUR SULLIVAN."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"This was a great moment in my life, although at the time my
        father, whose good judgment I valued much, was of opinion that I was
        not very successful as an actor. Sullivan, however, who had heard me
        give a musical sketch at a dinner party, was of the contrary opinion,
        and felt sure that I should suit him. It appears he and Arthur Cecil
        were both writing letters at the Beefsteak, when the former said, 'I
        can't find a fellow for this opera.' Cecil said, 'I wonder if
        Grossmith&mdash;' Before he had finished the sentence, Arthur
        Sullivan said, 'The very man!' And so I was engaged. I am much
        indebted to these two Arthurs," continued the bright little man with
        a laugh. "I reverence the very name of Arthur. I remember when
        Gilbert wanted to engage me for the part of <i>John Wellington
        Wells</i>, though I saw the part would suit me to perfection, I said
        to him, 'I should have thought you required a fine man with a fine
        voice for the part of a magician.' I can still see Gilbert's humorous
        expression as he replied, 'That is just what we <i>don't</i> want.' I
        played <i>Sir Joseph Porter</i> in 'Pinafore' every night for nearly
        two years. Long runs don't affect the nerves of the actors nearly as
        much as they affect the performance. Constant repetition begets
        mechanism, and that is a terrible enemy to contend against. I make a
        point of playing my best to a bad house; for it is a monstrous thing
        to slur through one's work because the stalls are empty, and thereby
        punish those who <i>have</i> come for the fault of those who <i>have
        not</i>. Still, I repeat it, constant repetition is a dreadful thing.
        Fancy playing 'Pinafore,' as I did, for 700 nights without missing a
        single performance!"</p>

        <p>As he said this Mr. Grossmith led the way out of the room in which
        we had been talking, and which he told me was his own special
        sanctum, "into which no one is ever allowed to come except my wife,
        for anyone rushing in here when I was composing or thinking out a
        sketch would inevitably drive every single idea from my head," and we
        went upstairs together. Here in the drawing-room he set himself down
        to a spinet which bore the date of 1770, and he struck a few
        exceedingly sweet-sounding, if slightly tinkling, chords from it.
        "And this," said he, "is the oldest <i>Broadwood</i> in England. You
        can see for yourself the date&mdash;1795." Downstairs he showed me a
        beautiful model of a steam engine, upon which he was enabled to ride,
        and which he could drive himself. "I thoroughly understand
        locomotives," said he, as he pointed to a shelf full of all the works
        upon the subject which he had been able to discover.</p>
