        <h2>Is Love a Practical Reality or a Pleasing Fiction?</h2>

        <p class="sidenote">Mrs. Lynn Linton thinks there is no doubt as to
        Love's reality.</p>

        <p>Of the desperate reality of the passion there is no doubt; of the
        intrinsic value of the thing beloved there may be many. The passion
        for which men and women have died stands like a tower four-square to
        all the winds of heaven; but how far that tower has been self-created
        by fancy, and how much is objectively real, who is the wise man that
        can determine? What is Love? We know nothing of its source. Sense and
        sex cannot wholly explain its mystery, else would there be no
        friendship left among us; and elective affinity is but a dainty
        carving on the chancel stalls. The loveliness which makes that
        special person the veritable Rose of the World to us exists but in
        our imagination. It is no rose that we adore&mdash;only at the best a
        bedeguar, of which the origin is a disagreeable little insect. We
        believe in the exquisite harmony of those atoms which have arranged
        themselves to form the thing we love. And we marry our human ideal,
        expecting the unbroken continuance of that harmony. But the discord
        comes; colours clash; the jarring note spoils the chord; the idol
        once accepted as of gold and precious stones, proves to be only
        common clay, thinly gilt. The diamonds are paste; the pearls are
        beads of glass filled with shining fishes' scales; and the love which
        we thought would be a practical reality for life, is nothing but a
        pleasing fiction, good for its day, and now dead and done with. The
        lover sees nothing as it is. Life is distorted between jealousy and
        admiration, and the plain teaching of common-sense is as little
        understood as the conditions of the fourth dimension or the poetic
        aspirations of the Simian tongue. The adored is not a real person;
        the happiness anticipated is not practical nor practicable. Both are
        on all-fours with the substantiality of a cloud and the serviceable
        roadway of a rainbow. Custom, familiarity, daily habits are the sole
        tests by which the reality of the thing beloved can be
        tried&mdash;the reality of the thing beloved and consequent validity
        of love. Before these tests are applied, the whole affair is as a
        fairy dream born of the perfume and the mystery of night. With the
        clear cold breath of morning the dream vanishes, but&mdash;what is
        left? The sigh of the vanishing god?&mdash;a tear on the cheek of
        Psyche?&mdash;the loathing of the man who finds M&eacute;lusine a
        serpent rather than a woman?&mdash;or the peaceful joy of the child
        who dreams of angels and wakes in its mother's arms?&mdash;of those
        who sleeping on the ocean wake to find themselves safe in port?</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">"Rita" thinks Love is beautiful and wise.</p>

        <p>At one period of life, love is simply an emotion&mdash;the outcome
        of attraction, or the effect of that vague mystery which surrounds
        sex. In this emotional stage the <i>feeling</i> may be real enough,
        but the passion is an illusion. A girl is often more in love with
        Love than with an actual lover. The youth who beholds his ideal in
        the First Woman is in love with the woman herself who for the time
        (usually very brief) embodies that ideal. But to the girl and the
        youth comes an hour when they are humiliatingly conscious of study
        wasted on a prettily-bound work of fiction that for all use and
        purpose in life is quite valueless. The edifice of romance is
        constructed much on the same plan as a child's castle of cards, and
        deservedly shares the same fate. That is to say, the topmost card
        overbalances the whole structure. It is usually the hand of Reason
        that topples over Love's romantic tenement by crowning it with the
        card of Common Sense. When we find Love has become a practical
        reality, the discovery is often very unpleasant. We would rather not
        be unhappy if we had the choice. Unfortunately, we haven't, and find
        ourselves in that condition without exactly knowing how we drifted
        into it. Drifters often discover Love to be a very practical reality,
        because of unpleasant consequences. It is decidedly humiliating to
        find ourselves in the toils of a siren the very reverse of our high
        ideal of the personage who is to have the honour and glory of
        subjugating us. This is one of Love's amusing little ways of proving
        that ideals are really not important. The best and safest test of the
        reality of Love is to ask yourself how much you have suffered on
        account of it. I don't speak of such trifles as tears, heartaches,
        sleepless nights, fevers of jealousy and despair, sacrifices, or
        discomforts, but of <i>real</i> genuine self-torment and mental
        torture which only this passion is capable of inflicting on its
        victims. The most sceptical will acknowledge that its powers in this
        line are only excelled by its apparent animosity. To discover the
        life that completes and contents our own is not given to many of us
        poor mortals. Here and there some fortunate individuals have made
        that discovery&mdash;but they are rare&mdash;and not given to
        boasting on the subject; yet though worldly wise folk scoff at love
        as a myth, I question whether they could name any other passion of
        the heart which has occupied so important a place in the world's
        history, which has given life to all that is great and divine in art,
        or inspired such deeds of heroism, self-sacrifice, and martyrdom.
        Before its patient strength men have stood mute and wondering, and
        proud heads have bent in reverence, and stern eyes grown dim. For
        Love is beautiful, despite faults, and wise, despite follies. It
        alone of all human emotions can lift our souls heavenwards, and make
        even life's thorny path a thing of beauty.</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">John Strange Winter's opinions.</p>

        <p>Love may be classed under several heads. The first, the great, the
        unattainable, the one-sided, and the worn-out. They are all real!
        What can be more real than the perhaps not very practical passion
        which first makes young hearts ache? What agony it is to <i>her</i>
        when <i>he</i> dances three times running with that horrid, stuck-up
        London girl, with her fashionable jargon, her languorous movements,
        just a turn or two, and then stop for as many minutes! First love is
        not often last love. <i>He</i> thinks <i>her</i> unreasonable to mind
        those dances, yet when a great love comes into her life, making her
        think of him as "just a boy," he suffers all, or nearly all, the
        pangs of a great passion. Unavailing pain! <i>She</i> has cast the
        die of her life, and past loves are shadows compared with the
        absorbing power that now grips her heart like a vice. Much may happen
        to the great love, but it is very real! A great love may merge into
        matrimony, and life may run on oiled wheels, and Darby and Joan may
        pass through the world, loving faithfully, and without digression, to
        the end. Or something may come between, and the great love may become
        the unattainable! It will not be the less real for that.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">The Unattainable.</p>

        <p>The unattainable has more in it of pathos than despair. Romance
        sweetens it, and the romance never dies. The tenderness of "what
        might have been" gives balm to many a suffering soul! The wife may be
        unhappy, neglected, heartsick, she may even loathe him whose name she
        bears, but she is often upholden by the thought that <i>he</i> would
        have been wholly different! A husband may know that he has married
        the wrong woman, yet he bears what is, because he cannot have
        <i>her</i> who would have made life all sunshine. Few pity the
        one-sided love, helpless, hopeless, and without justification as it
        is; yet it is very real to the lonely soul. The worn-out love is the
        very essence of sadness! It is heart-breaking to watch the efforts of
        a foolish heart to keep a love dying or already dead, to see love,
        which would once have made a paradise, poured out at the feet of one
        who is only bored and not even touched by it. Nothing is so dead as a
        dead love&mdash;yet, even <i>that</i> is real!</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">Miss May Crommelin takes a professional view</p>

        <p>Can any sensible novelist hesitate? Does a shoe-maker depreciate
        leather? Would you saw off the tree-branch you sit on? Now, on this
        subject, anybody's opinion (full-grown) is as good as another's. Let
        the footman bring down word that love is the drawing-room topic, and
        the cook will cry out, "What do they know more about it than
        <i>us</i>?" Is it not a human feeling, call it instinct or no? Surely
        old Sally Jones has simpler feelings than the Dowager Countess; as
        much experience in this. Love is just as real as a rainbow on a wet
        day; as&mdash;as influenza. The first may be a "pleysing payne": the
        latter must be a very displeasing one. But there is little fiction
        about either to the victims. Well, suppose love a mere brain-fantasm;
        an odd survival when sensible folk have swept away beliefs in
        witchcraft, fairies, and the virtue of fire and faggot for the wicked
        ones who don't say their prayers the same way we do. <i>Still, was it
        not worth while to have invented it?</i> However the idea was
        evoluted, just consider the glamour it throws over thorns and
        thistles, as we dig through life's long day of toil. As Trollope's
        stout widow says, when choosing her second: "It's a whiff of the
        rocks and the valleys." (So she had her marriage settlements tightly
        drawn up, to enjoy her romance comfortably.) Consider this
        epitaph&mdash;a real one&mdash;</p>

        <p class="sidenote">Miss Quiller Couch wishes Love were a pleasing
        fiction.</p>

        <p>"Pleasing fiction," forsooth; would that it were! It is a very
        real game, and the rules thereof are practical. I know it, for verily
        I myself have suffered. Let it not be understood, however, that it is
        <i>as</i> a "practical, real lover" that I have suffered. Not at all.
        It is that this order of beings walks abroad, and I am not of it, and
        I meet it, and I am pained, and I feel sorry. Could Love be but a
        pleasing fiction, how comfortable to sit aside and contemplate
        it&mdash;a trifle to talk of, a dainty to dally with, a joy to the
        juvenescent, a blessing to the book-writer, yet never an
        inconvenience. But it is a practical reality, and it has great
        effects. Why, I have seen good, healthy people, quite nice-tempered
        people, brought to a shadow by it and churned into so many pounds of
        incompetent irritability; <i>so</i> exacting about trifles, so
        fidgetty about catching the mail, and so careless of the health of
        the uninteresting majority. There was one man I knew down in a
        village, and he fell in love with a pretty girl&mdash;they mostly do
        that&mdash;but she would have nothing to say to him; and after every
        rejected proposal he went straight home and made a three-legged stool
        (he was a carpenter by trade, or perhaps it might have affected him
        differently). He was what one might call an importunate man, for he
        proposed nineteen times in all, and nineteen three-legged stools
        stood as silent witnesses of his importunity. He changed houses after
        the twelfth, for he found a sad joy in contemplating his handiwork as
        he sat at his lonely meals, and his first sitting-room was only
        twelve feet by eight. Finally, either because of his importunity, or
        because she disliked the thought that the wordless witnesses might
        fall into unsympathetic hands, the girl married the man, and scrubbed
        the stools nicely with soap and sand, and grew quite fond of them.
        And only once did she regret her surrender; and that was when it
        flashed across her one day that twenty would have been a prettier
        number: but she stifled that pain as years went on, and grew happy.
        Then there was Dante's love for Beatrice, which caused him to sit
        down and write such a lot. Most remarkable persons seem to have
        produced something rather excellent as the outcome of their love. I
        know a naturally lazy and slightly dingy boy who endured a nice clean
        collar every day, and it cut his neck, and his soul abhorred it, for
        he told me so; and he spent from seventy-five to ninety minutes over
        his toilet every morning, while he loved, and he knew he could dress
        in four minutes and a quarter, for he had done it often. Love was a
        great beautifier. In this case I must admit that the lover suffered
        more than we outsiders, except that he became irritable in his
        cleanliness. Love should not be scorned, even if it is real and
        sometimes uncomfortably practical. It is very beautiful, and lovers
        make a pretty sight. What I protest is, that all creatures should be
        lovers&mdash;or <i>none</i>. It is the half-and-half state of the
        world which is irksome.</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">Morley Roberts hopes Love will some day be a
        pleasing reality</p>

        <p>Ah, my gentle cocksure friends, how well you all know Love, and
        how ready you are to say what it is, to cut it up, to carve it, to
        classify it, and generally to spread it out. We live in a world of
        lies, and conventions, the dead leavings of an ignorant past, bind us
        still. Some day, perhaps, when men and women are free, Love will be a
        pleasing reality. It can never be so in the majority of cases so long
        as we play at make-believe, and teach nothing that we have learned.
        The good man won't teach his sons; he leaves them to learn in the
        gutter. The good woman keeps her daughters ignorant. As it stands it
        is an evil to love anyone over-much. And when we love we love
        over-much, for Love has been repressed till it has got savage in the
        race. "La privation radicale d'une chose cr&eacute;e
        l&eacute;xe&eacute;s." All the trouble comes from this&mdash;that we
        men have partially created women. But Nature had something to do with
        her compounding. That is, perhaps, a pity from the social point of
        view. For Nature can't be nice and comfortable. She is only kind when
        we go her way. Let us remember that Love is the foundation of the
        world. The very protoplasmic cells from which we sprang could love.
        The time will come, perhaps, when, having chipped away the lies and
        faced the truth, we shall find reality a thousand times more pleasing
        than any fiction. Love is something real and wonderful, and in a
        natural world we shall have passed through the blood-splashed gates
        of Passion and be calm. Now Love is tortured, for we love ignorantly.
        We are like shipwrecked folk on some strange land&mdash;we know not
        the fruits of the trees of it. We learn the poisons by experiment,
        and we let others learn. This is Love the Fiction. But some day when
        we awake we shall know what we now dream, and Love will be always the
        most precious flower that grows in the garden of the soul. It has the
        subtle fragrance of the heaven that is our own if we walk bravely in
        the world, desiring truth. Under its influence we discover ourselves.
        We build ships for new voyages, and burst into unknown waters with
        our Viking shields of victory ablaze in the morning sun. The air is
        sharp and keen, not foetid with poisonous lies; the waters are blue
        and beautiful; there are shining shores about us, and marvels of a
        new nature on every hand. We who were in the night, and of it, become
        vivid with the sun. Our atheism banishes the worshipped gods of evil
        that are no more extant in our dogmatic creed of joy. For Truth and
        Beauty have guided us hand in hand, and all they ask of us is to
        throw away the Law of Lies and to acknowledge that the two are
        one.</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">Zangwill reviews the evidence.</p>

        <p>The traces left by Love in life are so numerous and diverse that I
        am almost tempted to the hypothesis that it really exists. There
        seems to be no other way of accounting for the facts. When you start
        learning a new language you always find yourself confronted with the
        verb "to love"&mdash;invariably the normal type of the first
        conjugation. In every language on earth the student may be heard
        declaring, with more zeal than discretion, that he and you and they
        and every other person, singular or plural, have loved, and do love,
        and will love. "To love" is the model verb; expressing the archetype
        of activity. Once you can love grammatically there is a world of
        things you may do without stumbling. For, strange to say, "to love,"
        which in real life is associated with so much that is bizarre and
        violent, is always "regular" in grammar, and this without barring
        accidence of any kind. For ancient and modern tongues tell the same
        tale&mdash;from Hebrew to street-Arabic, from Greek to the
        elephantine language that was "made in Germany." Not only is "to
        love" deficient in no language (as <i>home</i> is deficient in
        French, and <i>Geist</i> in English), but it is never even
        "defective." No mood or tense is ever wanting&mdash;a proof of how it
        has been conjugated in every mood and tense of life, in association
        with every variety of proper and improper noun, and every pronoun at
        all personal. Not merely have people loved unconditionally in every
        language, but there is none in which they would not have loved, or
        might not have loved, had circumstances permitted; none in which they
        have not been loved, or (for hope springs eternal in the human
        breast) have been about to be loved. Even woman has an Active Voice
        in the matter; indeed, "to love" is so perfect that, compared with
        it, "to marry" is quite irregular. For, while "to love" is sufficient
        for both sexes, directly you get to marriage you find in some
        languages that division has crept in, and that there is one word for
        the use of ladies and another for gentlemen only. Turning from the
        evidence enshrined in language to the records of history, the same
        truth meets us at any date we appoint. Everywhere "'Tis love that
        makes the world go round," though more especially in ball-rooms. It
        is awful to think what would have happened if Eve had not accepted
        Adam. What could have attracted her if it was not love? Surely not
        his money, nor his family. For these she couldn't have cared a
        fig-leaf. Unfortunately, the daughters of Eve have not always taken
        after their mother. The statistics of crime and insanity testify
        eloquently to the reality of love, arithmetic teaching the same
        lesson as history and grammar. Consider, too, the piles of love at
        Mudie's! A million story-tellers in all periods and at all places
        cannot have told all stories, though they have all, alas! told the
        same story. They must have had mole-hills for their mountains, if not
        straw for their bricks. There are those who, with Bacon, consider
        love a variety of insanity; but it is more often merely a form of
        misunderstanding. When the misunderstanding is mutual, it may even
        lead to marriage. As a rule Beauty begets man's love, Power woman's.
        At least, so women tell me. But then, I am not beautiful. It must be
        said for the man that every lover is a species of Platonist&mdash;he
        identifies the Beautiful with the Good and the True. The woman's
        admiration has less of the ethical quality; she is dazzled, and too
        often feels, "If he be but true to me, what care I how false he be."
        The Romantic Love of the poets and novelists was of late birth; the
        savage and many civilisations knew it not, and philosophers explain
        that it could not be developed till Roman Law had developed the
        conception of Marriage as a Contract. Even to this day it is as rare
        as large paper editions of the books about it. Roughly speaking, I
        should say it would spring up here and there among all classes of the
        population, except poets and novelists. Romantic Love is the rose
        Evolution has grown on earthly soil. <i>Floreat!</i></p>

        <p class="sidenote">Burgin thinks it all depends on the people who
        love.</p>

        <p>One morning the average man gets up, lights his pipe, roams round
        his rooms in all the ease of unshaven countenance and
        dressing-gown-clad form. Then he goes out, and meets <i>her</i>.
        There may be a hundred women in the room, or park, or tennis ground,
        wherever the tragedy (Love is a tragedy) commences. When the lights
        are low he comes back, and is low also. Wonders how men can be such
        brutes as to want dinner; thinks his life has been misspent; that he
        is unworthy to touch her hand; that he has wallowed in the fleshpots,
        and here is a way out of them. And if the man's nature be noble and
        sweet and true; if he has hitherto drifted adown the stream of
        circumstance because his fellows have also drifted; then, with the
        deepening tides of his passion, the old spirit of knight-errantry
        descends upon him with its mystic mantle of white samite. And slowly
        out of this deepening torrent of bewildered impulse and devotion is
        born a new man&mdash;a man with a soul&mdash;a man who can dare all
        things, do all things, endure all things, for the sake of the woman
        he loves. At the baptism of her touch he becomes whole, and shapes
        his life to noble ends. Even if he can't marry her, he is the better
        for his passion. Such a love endures until the leaves of the Judgment
        Book unroll; for it laughs to scorn the pitiful fools who boast of
        infidelity, the "male hogs in armour," as Kingsley calls them, who
        look upon women as toys, the sport of an idle moment, rather than the
        spiritual force which leavens the world, and makes it an endurable
        and joyous dwelling-place.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">And on the woman loved.</p>

        <p>Of course, I was speaking of good women. I once heard a story
        about a bad woman&mdash;a woman of the world, who was very much
        amused at being taken seriously by a boy who loved her. "Tell me all
        about it," she would say to him. "Explain what you feel, why you love
        me, why you believe in me. Don't you see I'm courted and
        admired&mdash;a social force&mdash;that men flock round me everywhere
        I go?" "Oh, yes," said the boy, "I see all that. But you're an angel
        of goodness, and can't help men liking you. If I lost faith in you,
        I'd kill myself." "Ah," she rejoined, "that's what you all say. You
        would doubt me, and live on." Then, one afternoon, he had good cause
        to doubt, inasmuch as her engagement to another man was announced.
        That evening she received a note from him: "Good-bye. If I lived on,
        I might doubt; it's better to die and&mdash;believe!" They told her
        of the&mdash;the accident that night, and she wrote a touching little
        paragraph about it for the Society papers before dining out.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">Gribble generaliseth confidently.</p>

        <p>In a sense, of course, Love is necessarily a fiction, whether
        pleasing or otherwise; for illusion is of the essence of it. The
        lover, in fact, is like the artist who sees things through a
        temperament, and, by eliminating the irrelevant, builds up the ideal
        on the foundation of the real. Tityrus sees more in Amaryllis than
        his brother shepherds see, just as Mr. Whistler sees more in a
        November fog than is visible to the eye of the casual wayfarer who
        gets lost in it, and mingles profanity with his coughs, yet, granting
        this, the reality and completeness of the illusion does not admit of
        doubt. On no alternative hypothesis can the great majority of
        marriages be explained. If commonplace people saw each other as
        others see them, surely they would remain single all their lives. Yet
        most people are commonplace, and most people marry. The
        reality&mdash;the controlling over-mastering reality&mdash;of Love
        has to be assumed to make their behaviour intelligible.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">Having hasted from a wedding for the purpose.</p>

        <p>This point struck me forcibly the last time I was present at a
        wedding. It was a Jewish wedding, celebrated at the little synagogue
        behind the Haymarket. I had no acquaintance with anyone concerned in
        the ceremony, but had dropped in quite casually, having heard that
        Jewish weddings were picturesque. The one thing that impressed me
        more than anything else was the decided undesirability of both the
        bridegroom and the bride. That the bride was not comely goes for
        little. But her forehead indicated a limited range and low ideals;
        the corners of her mouth spoke of an irritable temper; her bearing
        was vulgar; her voice had a twang that made one long to take her by
        the shoulders and shake her violently. She was also escorted by gaudy
        female relatives, by looking at whom one could anticipate the awful
        possibilities of her maturity. As for the bridegroom, he was a Hebrew
        of the florid type. His waistcoat was protuberant; he had a red face
        with red whiskers sprawling all over it; he wore flash jewellery; his
        hair shone with pomatum; there was that in his bearing which
        indicated that he followed some sordid calling, such as pawnbroking,
        or the backing of horses on commission. Yet one could see that these
        two unattractive persons were really attracted by each other. A great
        and beautiful miracle had been performed; and the power which had
        performed it was that Love in which some profess to disbelieve.</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="sidenote">Frank Mathew displays his Ignorance.</p>

        <p>Ignorance&mdash;says some wiseacre&mdash;is the mother of
        eloquence, and I take it that the less one knows of Love the easier
        it is to write of it. I side with those who hold that the Love
        described by poets and other wordy people is mainly fanciful, a
        flattering picture, that the best school for such writing is an
        unhappy affection, and that no man can want better luck than to have
        his heart broken, and so be made proof against lovesickness. An
        unrequited love runs no risk of being dulled by the prose of life. A
        man so fortunate as to be jilted or rejected finds his Beloved
        remaining beautiful and young to him when her husband sees her an
        unwieldy and wearisome old woman. And when at times he grows
        sentimental&mdash;a bachelor's privilege&mdash;he can feel again the
        old hopes that he never found false, and see the old perfections that
        were never disproved. He has a life-companion who comes only when she
        is wanted, and then with a "smile on her face and a rose in her
        hair," whose voice is always gentle, to whom wrinkles are not
        necessary and bills are not known.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">And praises ugliness.</p>

        <p>I am one of those who prefer the luckless adorers in novels to the
        conquering heroes; and hold that the quality an ideal lover needs
        most is ugliness, so that he may honour beauty the more. Once I knew
        a boy who was uglier than sin, and who wrote a story&mdash;in a
        sprawling hand and on ruled paper&mdash;a wonderful story, telling
        how an unlovely but admirable Knight, worshipping a Princess, rode
        out to win her by great deeds, and how when he came back triumphant,
        the sight of her brought his unworthiness home to him so that he
        dared not claim her. And I knew another boy who was good-looking, and
        wrote a story (during study-time, of course, and by stealth) about a
        handsome hero who went to Court in fine clothes, and was worshipped
        by all the girls. I think now that he was the manlier, but that the
        first would have made the more devout lover. But the drawback of
        luckless adorers is that their constancy has not been tried by the
        ordeal of success. Many a fellow who lived loyal and heart-broken
        would have made an unfaithful husband.</p>

        <p class="sidenote">'Q.' is surprised at his sister.</p>

        <p>Love, no doubt, is a subject of popular interest, but a man is
        always staggered to find his sister holding an opinion upon it. If I
        remember rightly, in the days when Lilian Quiller Couch (then aged
        seven) did me the honour of playing Juliet to my Romeo, the interest
        was mainly acrobatic, Romeo descending the gardener's ladder
        head-foremost, while Juliet tilted her body as far over the nursery
        window-sill as she could manage without breaking her neck. We "cut"
        the love speeches. Two years later, indeed, my sister schemed to
        marry me to our common governess. There was no love on my side; so
        she turned over the Prayer-book, hoping to find "A man may not marry
        his governess" in the table of Forbidden Degrees. Such a prohibition
        (she well knew) would be a trumpet-call to my native spirit of
        disobedience. But I am convinced that even then the nature of true
        affection did not enter into her calculations. She merely counted on
        my marital influence to end or mend the French irregular verbs. I am
        delighted that, in these later days, she sees Love to be a "practical
        reality." For my part, I want a definition. Popular custom bestows
        the name of Love on a green sickness which is in fact a part of
        Nature's wise economy. I will expound. Almost all young men, say
        between the ages of nineteen and twenty-five, incline to consume much
        meat and do next to no work. Were there no corrective, it is clear
        that in a few years the face of the earth would be eaten bare as by
        locusts. But at this season Nature by the simplest stroke&mdash;the
        flush of a commonplace cheek, the warm touch of a commonplace
        hand&mdash;in a twinkling redresses the balance. Forthwith the ideal
        devourer of crops and herbs not only loses his appetite, but arising,
        smacks the earth with a hoe till the clods fly and the fields laugh
        with harvest. Thereon he mops his steaming brow, bedecks him with a
        bunch of white ribbons, and jogs jovially to church arm in arm with
        the pretty cause of all this beneficent disturbance. And the
        spectacle is mighty taking and commendable; but you'll excuse me for
        holding that it is not Love. It bears about the same relation to Love
        that Bumble-puppy bears to good whist. Among the eccentricities that
        make up the Average Man I find none more diverting than his
        complacent belief that he is, or has been, or will certainly some day
        be, in love. As a matter of fact, the capacity to love belongs to one
        man or woman in ten thousand. Listen to Matthew Arnold:</p>

        <p>I go further and believe it rarer even than Genius. Indeed, the
        capacity to love, is a specialised form of genius. You understand
        that I am not commending it. Its possessors are often disreputable
        and almost always unhappy. Their recompense is that they, and they
        only, have seen the splendours of the passion, and vibrated to the
        shaking inner music of the sheep-boy's pipe.</p>
