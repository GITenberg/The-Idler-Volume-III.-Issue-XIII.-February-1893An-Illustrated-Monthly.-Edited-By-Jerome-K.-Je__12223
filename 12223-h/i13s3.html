            "DISCUSSION AT OUR LAST MEETING."</p>
        </div>

        <p>The final question discussed at our last meeting had been: What
        shall our hero be? MacShaugnassy had suggested an author, with a
        critic for the villain. Brown's fancy was an artist. My idea was a
        stockbroker, with an undercurrent of romance in his nature. Said
        Jephson, who has a practical mind, approaching at times the
        commercial: "The question is not what we like, but what the female
        novel-reader likes."</p>

        <p>"That is so," agreed MacShaugnassy. "I propose that we collect
        feminine opinion upon this point. I will write to my aunt, and get
        from her the old lady's view. You," he said, turning to me, "can put
        the case to your wife, and get the young lady's ideal. Let Brown
        write to his sister at Newnham, and find out whom the intellectual
        maiden favours, while Jephson can learn from Miss Medbury what is
        most attractive to the common-sensed girl."</p>

        <p>This plan we had adopted, and the result was now under
        consideration. MacShaugnassy opened the proceedings by reading his
        aunt's letter. Wrote the old lady:</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I think, if I were you, my dear boy, I should choose a soldier.
            You know your poor grandfather, who ran away to America with that
            <i>wicked</i> Mrs. Featherly, the banker's wife, was a soldier,
            and so was your poor cousin Robert, who lost eight thousand
            pounds at Monte Carlo. I have always felt singularly drawn
            towards soldiers, even as a girl; though your poor dear uncle
            could not bear them. You will find many allusions to soldiers and
            men of war in the Old Testament (see Jer. 48,14). Of course one
            does not like to think of their fighting and killing each other,
            but then they do not seem to do much of that sort of thing
            nowadays."
        </blockquote>

        <p>"So much for the old lady," said MacShaugnassy, as he folded up
        the letter and returned it to his pocket. "What says culture?"</p>

            <p class="figure"><a href="images/035-1.jpg"><img src=

            BROWN READ AS FOLLOWS.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Brown produced from his cigar-case a letter addressed in a bold
        round hand, and read as follows:</p>

        <blockquote>
            "What a curious coincidence! A few of us were discussing this
            very subject last night in Millicent Hightopper's rooms, and I
            may tell you at once that our decision was unanimous in favour of
            soldiers. You see, my dear Selkirk, in human nature the
            attraction is towards the opposite. To a milliner's apprentice a
            poet would no doubt be satisfying; to a woman of intelligence he
            would be an unutterable bore. The man of brain is not for the
            woman of brain. What the intellectual woman requires in man is
            not something to argue with, but something to look at. To an
            empty-headed woman I can imagine the soldier type proving vapid
            and uninteresting; to the woman of mind he represents her ideal
            of man&mdash;a creature strong, handsome, well-dressed, and not
            too clever."
        </blockquote>

        <p>"That gives us two votes for the army," remarked MacShaugnassy, as
        Brown tore his sister's letter in two, and threw the pieces into the
        waste-paper basket. "What says the common-sensed girl?"</p>

        <p>"First catch your common-sensed girl," muttered Jephson, a little
        grumpily, as it seemed to me. "Where do you propose finding her?"</p>

        <p>"Well," returned MacShaugnassy, "I looked to find her in Miss
        Medbury."</p>

        <p>As a rule, the mention of Miss Medbury's name brings a flush of
        joy to Jephson's face; but now his features wore an expression
        distinctly approaching a scowl.</p>

        <p>"Oh!" he replied, "did you? Well, then, the common-sensed girl
        loves the military, also."</p>

        <p>"By Jove!" exclaimed MacShaugnassy, "what an extraordinary thing.
        What reason does she give?"</p>

        <p>"That they look so nice when they're dressed, and that they dance
        so divinely," answered Jephson, shortly.</p>

        <p>"Well, you do surprise me," murmured MacShaugnassy, "I am
        astonished."</p>

        <p>Then to me he said: "And what does the young married woman say?
        The same?"</p>

        <p>"Yes," I replied, "precisely the same."</p>

        <p>"Does <i>she</i> give a reason?" he asked.</p>

        <p>"Oh, yes," I explained; "because you can't help liking them."</p>

        <p>There was silence for the next few minutes, while we smoked and
        thought. I fancy we were all wishing we had never started this
        enquiry.</p>

        <p>That four distinctly different types of educated womanhood should,
        with promptness and unanimity quite unfeminine, have selected the
        soldier as their ideal, was certainly discouraging to the civilian
        heart. Had they been nursemaids or servant girls, I should have
        expected it. The worship of Mars by the Venus of the white cap is one
        of the few vital religions left to this devoutless age. A year or two
        ago I lodged near a barracks, and the sight to be seen round its huge
        iron gates on Sunday afternoons I shall never forget. The girls began
        to assemble about twelve o'clock. By two, at which hour the army,
        with its hair nicely oiled and a cane in its hand, was ready for a
        stroll, there would be some four or five hundred of them waiting in a
        line. Formerly they had collected in a wild mob, and as the soldiers
        were let out to them two at a time, had fought for them, as lions for
        early Christians. This, however, had led to scenes of such disorder
        and brutality, that the police had been obliged to interfere; and the
        girls were now marshalled in <i>queue</i>, two abreast, and
        compelled, by a force of constables specially told off for the
        purpose, to keep their places and wait their proper turn.</p>

        <p>At three o'clock the sentry on duty would come down to the wicket
        and close it. "They're all gone, my dears," he would shout out to the
        girls still left; "it's no good your stopping, we've no more for you
        to-day."</p>

        <p>"Oh, not one!" some poor child would murmur pleadingly, while the
        tears welled up into her big round eyes, "not even a little one. I've
        been waiting <i>such</i> a long time."</p>

        <p>"Can't help that," the honest fellow would reply, gruffly, but not
        unkindly, turning aside to hide his emotion; "you've had 'em all
        between you. We don't make 'em, you know: you can't have 'em if we
        haven't got 'em, can you? Come earlier next time."</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/037-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/037-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "NOW THEN, PASS ALONG."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Then he would hurry away to escape further importunity; and the
        police, who appeared to have been waiting for this moment with
        gloating anticipation, would jeeringly hustle away the weeping
        remnant. "Now then, pass along, you girls, pass along," they would
        say, in that irritatingly unsympathetic voice of theirs. "You've had
        your chance. Can't have the roadway blocked up all the afternoon with
        this 'ere demonstration of the unloved. You'll have to put up with
        your ordinary young men for to-day. Pass along."</p>

        <p>In connection with this same barracks, our charwoman told Amenda,
        who told Ethelbertha, who told me a story, which I now told the
        boys.</p>

        <p>Into a certain house, in a certain street in the neighbourhood,
        there moved one day a certain family. Their servant had left
        them&mdash;most of their servants did at the end of a week&mdash;and
        the day after the moving-in an advertisement was drawn up and sent to
        the <i>Chronicle</i> for a domestic. It ran thus:</p>

        <blockquote>
            WANTED GENERAL SERVANT, in small family of eleven. Wages,
            &pound;6; no beer money. Must be early riser and hard worker.
            Washing done at home. Must be good cook, and not object to
            window-cleaning. Unitarian preferred.&mdash;Apply, with
            references, to A. B., &amp;C.
        </blockquote>

        <p>That advertisement was sent off on Wednesday afternoon. At seven
        o'clock on Thursday morning the whole family were awakened by
        continuous ringing of the street door bell. The husband, looking out
        of window, was surprised to see a crowd of about fifty girls
        surrounding the house. He slipped on his dressing-gown and went down
        to see what was the matter. The moment he opened the door, fifteen of
        them charged tumultuously into the passage, sweeping him completely
        off his legs. Once inside, these fifteen faced round, fought the
        other thirty-five or so back on to the door-step, and slammed the
        door in their faces. Then they picked up the master of the house, and
        asked him politely to conduct them to "A. B."</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:50%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/038-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/038-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "SURPRISED TO SEE ABOUT FIFTY GIRLS."</p>
        </div>

        <p>At first, owing to the clamour of the mob outside, who were
        hammering at the door and shouting curses through the keyhole on
        those inside, he was too confused to understand anything, but by dint
        of great exertion they succeeded at length in explaining to him that
        they were domestic servants come in answer to his wife's
        advertisement. The man went and told his wife, and his wife said she
        would see them, one at a time.</p>

        <p>Which one should have audience first was a delicate question to
        decide. The man, on being appealed to, said he would prefer to leave
        it to them. They accordingly discussed the matter among themselves.
        At the end of a quarter of an hour, the victor, having borrowed a
        packet of pins and a looking-glass from our charwoman, who had slept
        in the house, went upstairs, while the remaining fourteen sat down in
        the hall, and fanned themselves with their bonnets.</p>

        <p>"A. B." was a good deal astonished when the first applicant
        presented herself. She was a tall, genteel-looking, well-dressed
        girl. Up to yesterday she had been head housemaid at Lady Stanton's,
        and before that she had been under-cook for two years to the Duchess
        of York.</p>

        <p>"And why did you leave Lady Stanton?" asked "A. B."</p>

        <p>"To come here, mum," replied the girl.</p>

        <p>The lady was puzzled.</p>

        <p>"And you'll be satisfied with six pounds a year?" she asked.</p>

        <p>"Certainly, mum, I think it ample."</p>

        <p>"And you don't mind hard work?"</p>

        <p>"I love it, mum."</p>

        <p>"And you're an early riser?"</p>

        <p>"Oh yes, mum, it upsets me stopping in bed after half-past
        five."</p>

        <p>"You know we do the washing at home?"</p>

        <p>"Yes, mum. I think it so much better to do it at home. Those
        laundries ruin good clothes. They're so careless."</p>

        <p>"Are you a Unitarian?" continued the lady.</p>

        <p>"Not yet, mum," replied the girl, "but I should like to be
        one."</p>

        <p>The lady took her reference, and said she would write her.</p>

        <p>"I do hope you will give me a trial, mum," pleaded the girl, as
        she rose to go; "I would try so hard to give you satisfaction."</p>

        <p>The next applicant offered to come for three pounds&mdash;thought
        six pounds too much. She also expressed her willingness to sleep in
        the back kitchen: a shakedown under the sink was all she wanted. She
        likewise had yearnings towards Unitarianism.</p>

        <p>The third girl did not require any wages at all&mdash;could not
        understand what servants wanted with wages&mdash;thought wages only
        encouraged a love of foolish finery&mdash;thought a comfortable home
        in a Unitarian family ought to be sufficient wages for any girl.</p>

        <p>This girl said there was one stipulation she should like to make,
        and that was that she should be allowed to pay for all breakages
        caused by her own carelessness or neglect. She objected to holidays
        and evenings out on principle; she held that they distracted a girl
        from her work.</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:30%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/039-1.jpg"><img src=

            "MET THE NEXT DOOR LADY ON THE DOOR-STEP."</p>
        </div>

        <p>The fourth candidate offered a premium of five pounds for the
        place; and then "A.B." began to get frightened, and refused to see
        any more of the girls, convinced that they must be lunatics from some
        neighbouring asylum out for a walk.</p>

        <p>Later in the day, meeting the next door lady on the door-step, she
        related her morning's experiences.</p>

        <p>"Oh, that's nothing extraordinary," said the next door lady; "none
        of us on this side of the street pay wages; and we get the pick of
        all the best servants in London. Why, girls will come from the other
        end of the kingdom to get into one of these houses. It's the dream of
        their lives. They save up for years, so as to be able to come here
        for nothing."</p>

        <p>"What's the attraction?" asked "A. B.," more amazed than ever.</p>

        <p>"Why, don't you see," explained the next door lady, "our back
        windows open upon the barrack yard. A girl living in one of these
        houses is always close to soldiers. By looking out of window she can
        always see soldiers; and sometimes a soldier will nod to her, or even
        call up to her. They never dream of asking for wages. They'll work
        eighteen hours a day, and put up with anything just to be allowed to
        stop."</p>

        <p>"A.B." profited by this information, and engaged the girl who
        offered the five pounds premium. She found her a perfect treasure of
        a servant. She was invariably willing and respectful, slept on a sofa
        in the kitchen, and was always contented with an egg for her
        dinner.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/040-1.jpg"><img src=

            "A SOLDIER'S ARM ROUND THE WAIST."</p>
        </div>

        <p>The truth of this story I cannot vouch for. Myself, I can believe
        it. Brown and MacShaugnassy made no attempt to do so, which seemed
        unfriendly. Jephson excused himself on the plea of a headache. I
        admit there are points in it presenting difficulties to the average
        intellect. As I explained at the commencement, it was told to me by
        Ethelbertha, who had it from Amenda, who got it from the charwoman,
        and exaggerations may have crept into it. The following, however,
        were incidents that came under my own personal observation. They
        afforded a still stronger example of the influence exercised by Tommy
        Atkins upon the British domestic, and I therefore thought it right to
        relate them also to the boys.</p>

        <p>"The heroine of them," I said, "is our Amenda. Now, you would call
        her a tolerably well-behaved, orderly young woman, would you
        not?"</p>

        <p>"She is my ideal of unostentatious respectability," answered
        MacShaugnassy.</p>

        <p>"That was my opinion also," I replied. "You can, therefore,
        imagine my feelings on passing her one evening in the Folkestone High
        Street with a Panama hat upon her head (my Panama hat), and a
        soldier's arm round her waist. She was one of a mob, composed of all
        the unoccupied riff-raff of Folkestone, who were following the band
        of the Third Berkshire Infantry, then in camp at Sandgate. There was
        an ecstatic, far-away look in her eyes. She was dancing rather than
        walking, and with her left hand she beat time to the music."</p>

        <p>"I should say you were suffering from a mild attack of D.T. when
        you saw all that," said MacShaugnassy.</p>

        <p>"So I might have thought myself," I said; "but Ethelbertha was
        with me at the time, and she saw it too. We stared after the
        procession until it had turned the corner, and then we stared at each
        other.</p>

        <p>"'Oh, it's impossible,' said Ethelbertha to me.</p>

        <p>"'But that was my hat,' I said to Ethelbertha.</p>

        <p>"The moment we reached home Ethelbertha looked for Amenda, and I
        looked for my hat. Neither were to be found.</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:30%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/041-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/041-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "AND HUNG MY HAT UP."</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Nine o'clock struck, ten o'clock struck. At half-past ten, we
        went down and got our own supper, and had it in the kitchen. At a
        quarter-past eleven, Amenda returned. She walked into the kitchen
        without a word, hung my hat up behind the door, and commenced
        clearing away the supper things.</p>

        <p>"Ethelbertha rose, calm but severe.</p>

        <p>"'Where have you been, Amenda?' she enquired.</p>

        <p>"'Gadding half over the county with a lot of low soldiers,'
        answered Amenda, continuing her work.</p>

        <p>"'You had on my hat,' I added, somewhat gloomily. It was not the
        right view to take of the case, I know, but, personally, that fact
        grieved me more than all the other incidents in the proceeding put
        together, sad though I felt these to be. It was an expensive hat, and
        Ethelbertha said it suited me (there are not many that do). After
        seeing it that night on Amenda's head, my pride in it was gone.</p>

        <p>"'Yes, sir,' replied Amenda, still continuing her work, 'it was
        the first thing that came to hand. What I'm thankful for is that it
        wasn't missis's best bonnet.'</p>

        <p>"Whether Ethelbertha was mollified by the proper spirit displayed
        in this last remark, I cannot say, but I think it probable. At all
        events, it was in a voice more of sorrow than of anger that she
        resumed her examination.</p>

        <p>"'You were walking with a soldier's arm around your waist when we
        passed you, Amenda?' she observed interrogatively.</p>

        <p>"'I know, mum,' admitted Amenda, 'I found it there myself when the
        music stopped.'</p>

        <p>"Ethelbertha looked her enquiries. Amenda filled a saucepan with
        water, and then replied to them.</p>

        <p>"'I'm a disgrace to a decent household,' she said; 'no mistress
        who respected herself would keep me a moment. I ought to be put out
        on the doorstep with my box and a month's wages.'</p>

        <p>"'But why did you do it then?' said Ethelbertha, with natural
        astonishment.</p>

        <p>"'Because I'm a helpless ninny, mum.' There was no trace of
        bitterness or passion in Amenda's tones. She spoke in the calm, even
        voice of a person stating facts.</p>

        <p>"'I can't help myself,' she went on; 'if I see soldiers I'm bound
        to follow them. It runs in our family. My poor cousin Emma was just
        such another fool. She was engaged to be married to a quiet,
        respectable young fellow with a shop of his own, and three days
        before the wedding she ran off with a regiment of marines and married
        the colour-sergeant. That's what I shall end by doing. I've been all
        the way to Sandgate with that lot you saw me with, and I've kissed
        four of them&mdash;the nasty wretches. I'm a nice sort of girl to be
        walking out with a respectable milkman.'</p>

        <p>"She was so deeply disgusted with herself that it seemed
        superfluous for anybody else to be indignant with her; and
        Ethelbertha changed her tone and tried to comfort her.</p>

        <p>"'Oh, you'll get over all that nonsense, Amenda,' she said,
        laughingly; 'you see yourself how silly it is. You must tell Mr.
        Bowles to keep you away from soldiers.'</p>

        <p>"'Ah, I can't look at it in the same light way that you do, mum,'
        returned Amenda, somewhat reprovingly; 'a girl that can't see a bit
        of red marching down the street without wanting to rush out and
        follow it ain't fit to be anybody's wife. Why I should be leaving the
        shop with nobody in it about twice a week, and he'd have to go the
        round of all the barracks in London, looking for me. I shall save up
        and get myself into a lunatic asylum, that's what I shall do.'</p>

        <p>"Ethelbertha began to grow quite troubled. 'But surely this is
        something altogether new, Amenda,' she said; 'you must have often met
        soldiers when you've been out in London?'</p>

        <p>"'Oh, yes, one or two at a time, walking about anyhow, I can stand
        that all right. It's when there's a lot of them all together with a
        band that I lose my head.'</p>

            "'WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF THEM WITH A BAND, I LOSE MY HEAD.'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>"'You don't know what it's like, mum,' she added, noticing
        Ethelbertha's puzzled expression; 'you've never had it. I only hope
        you never may.'</p>

        <p>"We kept a careful watch over Amenda during the remainder of our
        stay at Folkestone, and an anxious time we had of it. Every day some
        regiment or other would march through the town, and at the first
        sound of its music Amenda would become restless and excited. The Pied
        Piper's reed could not have stirred the Hamelin children deeper than
        did those Sandgate bands the heart of our domestic. Fortunately, they
        generally passed early in the morning when we were indoors, but one
        day, returning home to lunch, we heard distant strains dying away
        upon the Hythe Road. We hurried in. Ethelbertha ran down into the
        kitchen; it was empty!&mdash;up into Amenda's bedroom; it was vacant!
        We called. There was no answer.</p>

        <p>"'That miserable girl has gone off again,' said Ethelbertha. 'What
        a terrible misfortune it is for her. It's quite a disease.'</p>

        <p>"Ethelbertha wanted me to go to Sandgate camp and enquire for her.
        I was sorry for the girl myself, but the picture of a young and
        innocent-looking man wandering about a complicated camp, enquiring
        for a lost domestic, presenting itself to my mind, I said that I'd
        rather not.</p>

        <p>"Ethelbertha thought me heartless, and said that if I would not go
        she would go herself. I replied that I thought one female member of
        my household was enough in that camp at a time, and requested her not
        to. Ethelbertha expressed her sense of my inhuman behaviour by
        haughtily declining to eat any lunch, and I expressed my sense of her
        unreasonableness by sweeping the whole meal into the grate, after
        which Ethelbertha suddenly developed exuberant affection for the cat
        (who didn't want anybody's love, but wanted to get under the grate
        after the lunch), and I became supernaturally absorbed in the
        day-before-yesterday's newspaper.</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:30%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/044-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/044-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "'WHO LOCKED YOU IN THERE?'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>"In the afternoon, strolling out into the garden, I heard the
        faint cry of a female in distress. I listened attentively, and the
        cry was repeated. I thought it sounded like Amenda's voice, but where
        it came from I could not conceive. It drew nearer, however, as I
        approached the bottom of the garden, and at last I located it in a
        small wooden shed, used by the proprietor of the house as a dark room
        for developing photographs.</p>

        <p>"The door was locked. 'Is that you, Amenda?' I cried through the
        keyhole.</p>

        <p>"'Yes, sir,' came back the muffled answer. 'Will you please let me
        out; you'll find the key on the ground near the door.'</p>

        <p>"I discovered it on the grass about a yard away, and released her.
        'Who locked you in there?' I asked.</p>

        <p>"'I did, sir,' she replied; 'I locked myself in, and pushed the
        key out under the door. I had to do it, or I should have gone off
        with those beastly soldiers.'</p>

        <p>"'I hope I haven't inconvenienced you, sir,' she added, stepping
        out; 'I left the lunch all laid.'"</p>

        <p>Amenda's passion for soldiers was her one tribute to sentiment.
        Towards all others of the male sex she maintained an attitude of
        callous unsusceptibility, and her engagements with them (which were
        numerous) were entered into or abandoned on grounds so sordid as to
        seriously shock Ethelbertha.</p>

        <p>When she came to us she was engaged to a pork butcher&mdash;with a
        milkman in reserve. For Amenda's sake we dealt with the man, but we
        never liked him, and we liked his pork still less. When, therefore,
        Amenda announced to us that her engagement with him was "off," and
        intimated that her feelings would in no way suffer by our going
        elsewhere for our bacon, we secretly rejoiced.</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:60%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/045-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/045-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "HER ENGAGEMENT WAS 'OFF.'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>"I am confident you have done right, Amenda," said Ethelbertha;
        "you would never have been happy with that man."</p>

        <p>"No, mum, I don't think I ever should," replied Amenda. "I don't
        see how any girl could as hadn't got the digestion of an
        ostrich."</p>

        <p>Ethelbertha looked puzzled. "But what has digestion got to do with
        it?" she asked.</p>

        <p>"A pretty good deal, mum," answered Amenda, "when you're thinking
        of marrying a man as can't make a sausage fit to eat."</p>

        <p>"But, surely," exclaimed Ethelbertha, "you don't mean to say
        you're breaking off the match because you don't like his
        sausages!"</p>

        <p>"Well, I suppose that's what it comes to," agreed Amenda,
        unconcernedly.</p>

        <p>"What an awful idea!" sighed poor Ethelbertha, after a long pause.
        "Do you think you ever really loved him?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, yes," said Amenda, "I loved him right enough, but it's no
        good loving a man that wants you to live on sausages that keep you
        awake all night."</p>

        <p>"But does he want you to live on sausages?" persisted
        Ethelbertha.</p>

        <p>"Oh, he doesn't say anything about it," explained Amenda; "but you
        know what it is, mum, when you marry a pork butcher: you're expected
        to eat what's left over. That's the mistake my poor cousin Eliza
        made. She married a muffin man. Of course, what he didn't sell they
        had to finish up themselves. Why, one winter, when he had a run of
        bad luck, they lived for two months on nothing but muffins. I never
        saw a girl so changed in all my life. One has to think of these
        things, you know."</p>

        <p>Later on, she engaged herself to a solicitor's messenger. She did
        this&mdash;as she frankly avowed to Ethelbertha&mdash;to assist her
        family, who were prosecuting some petty law case at the time. He was
        a smart, steady man, a great favourite with his employers, and, out
        of kindly feeling towards him, they did the business for Amenda's
        father, charging only "out-of-pockets."</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/046-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/046-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "GAVE HER A COCOANUT."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Six months after the case was ended, she broke off the match. She
        said that, on reflection, she could not help seeing what an advantage
        he would have over her&mdash;he being in a solicitor's office, with
        the law at his fingers' ends&mdash;should she ever find it necessary
        to summons him.</p>

        <p>"But, my good girl," said Ethelbertha, quite distressed, "one
        doesn't marry a man with the idea of subsequently summonsing
        him!"</p>

        <p>"No, mum," said Amenda, "one always hopes one will never need to,
        I'm sure, but it's just as well to be prepared. I knew a girl, when I
        was in service at Hastings, that loved a printer, and they were both
        going to commit suicide because her parents didn't want 'em to marry;
        and now he costs her four shillings a month regular in summonses.
        It's no good shutting one's eyes to things, mum."</p>

        <p>But the most shamefully mercenary engagement that I think Amenda
        ever entered into was one with a 'bus conductor. We were living in
        the North of London then, and she had a young man, a cheesemonger,
        who kept a shop in Lupus Street, Chelsea. He could not come up to her
        because of the shop, so once a week she used to go down to him. One
        did not ride ten miles for a penny in those days, and she found the
        fare from Holloway to Victoria and back a severe tax upon her purse.
        The same 'bus that took her down at six brought her back at ten.
        During the first journey the 'bus conductor stared at Amenda; during
        the second he talked to her, during the third he gave her a cocoanut,
        during the fourth he proposed to her, and was promptly accepted.
        After that, Amenda was enabled to visit her cheesemonger without
        expense.</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/047-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/047-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "'I DESIRE SHARING CROSS.'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>He was a quaint character himself, was this 'bus conductor. I
        often rode with him to Fleet Street. He knew me quite well (I suppose
        Amenda must have pointed me out to him), and would always ask me
        after her&mdash;aloud, before all the other passengers, which was
        trying&mdash;and give me messages to take back to her. Where women
        were concerned he had what is called "a way" with him, and from the
        extent and variety of his female acquaintance, and the evident
        tenderness with which the majority of them regarded him, I am
        inclined to hope that Amenda's desertion of him (which happened
        contemporaneously with her jilting of the cheesemonger) caused him
        less prolonged suffering than might otherwise have been the case.</p>

        <p>He was a man from whom I derived a good deal of amusement one way
        and another. Thinking of him brings back to my mind a somewhat odd
        incident.</p>

        <p>One afternoon, I jumped upon his 'bus in the Seven Sisters Road.
        An elderly Frenchman was the only other occupant of the vehicle. "You
        vil not forget me," the Frenchman was saying as I entered, "I desire
        Sharing Cross."</p>

        <p>"I won't forget yer," answered the conductor, "you shall 'ave yer
        Sharing Cross. Don't make a fuss about it."</p>

        <p>"That's the third time 'ee's arst me not to forget 'im," he
        remarked to me in a stentorian aside; "'ee don't giv' yer much chance
        of doin' it, does 'ee?"</p>

        <p>At the corner of the Holloway Road we drew up, and our conductor
        began to shout after the manner of his species: "Charing
        Cross&mdash;Charing Cross&mdash;'ere yer are&mdash;Come along,
        lady&mdash;Charing Cross."</p>

        <p>The little Frenchman jumped up, and prepared to exit; the
        conductor pushed him back.</p>

        <p>"Sit down and don't be silly," he said; "this ain't Charing
        Cross."</p>

        <p>The Frenchman looked puzzled, but collapsed meekly. We picked up a
        few passengers, and proceeded on our way. Half a mile up the
        Liverpool Road a lady stood on the kerb regarding us as we passed
        with that pathetic mingling of desire and distrust which is the
        average woman's attitude towards conveyances of all kinds. Our
        conductor stopped.</p>

        <p>"Where d'yer want to go to?" he asked her severely&mdash;omnibus
        conductors have a manner of addressing all pedestrians as though they
        were lost children or suspicious
        loiterers&mdash;"Strand&mdash;Charing Cross?"</p>

        <div style="float:right; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/048-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/048-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "THE CONDUCTOR COLLARED HIM."</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Frenchman did not hear or did not understand the first part of
        the speech, but he caught the words "Charing Cross," and bounced up
        and out on to the step. The conductor collared him as he was getting
        off, and jerked him back savagely.</p>

        <p>"Carnt yer keep still a minute," he cried indignantly; "blessed if
        you don't want lookin' after like a bloomin' kid."</p>

        <p>"I vont to be put down at Sharing Cross," answered the little
        Frenchman, humbly.</p>

        <p>"You vont to be put down at Sharing Cross," repeated the other
        bitterly, as he led him back to his seat. "I shall put yer down in
        the middle of the road if I 'ave much more of yer. You stop there
        till I come and sling yer out. I ain't likely to let yer go much past
        yer Sharing Cross, I shall be too jolly glad to get rid o' yer."</p>

        <p>The poor Frenchman subsided, and we jolted on. At "The Angel" we,
        of course, stopped. "Charing Cross," shouted the conductor, and up
        sprang the Frenchman.</p>

        <p>"Oh, my Gawd," said the conductor, taking him by the shoulders and
        forcing him down into the corner seat, "wot am I to do? Carnt
        somebody sit on 'im?"</p>

        <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
            <p class="figure"><a href="images/049-1.jpg"><img src=
            "images/049-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></a><br />
            "'BLESSED IF I DIDN'T RUN HIM ON TO VICTORIA.'"</p>
        </div>

        <p>He held him firmly down until the 'bus started, and then released
        him. At the top of Chancery Lane the same scene took place, and the
        poor little Frenchman became exasperated.</p>

        <p>"He keep on saying Sharing Cross, Sharing Cross," he exclaimed,
        turning to the other passengers; "and it is <i>not</i> Sharing Cross.
        He is fool."</p>

        <p>"Carnt yer understand," retorted the conductor, equally indignant;
        "of course I say Sharing Cross&mdash;I mean Charing Cross, but that
        don't mean that it <i>is</i> Charing Cross. That means that&mdash;"
        and then perceiving from the blank look in the Frenchman's face the
        utter impossibility of ever making the matter clear to him, he turned
        to us with an appealing gesture, and asked:</p>

        <p>"Does any gentleman know the French for 'bloomin' idiot'?"</p>

        <p>A day or two afterwards, I happened to enter his omnibus
        again.</p>

        <p>"Well," I asked him, "did you get your French friend to Charing
        Cross all right?"</p>

        <p>"No, sir," he replied, "you'll 'ardly believe it, but I 'ad a bit
        of a row with a policeman just before I got to the corner, and it put
        'im clean out o' my 'ead. Blessed if I didn't run 'im on to
        Victoria."</p>
