            HIS MAIDEN AUNT.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I was a man born to misfortune. In fact, my first misfortune, the
        death of my father, happened three months before I came into the
        world. When I did duly appear, and was giving a proper howl of
        disgust, a fresh misfortune fell upon me; my mother departed to join
        my father, leaving me in the lurch in a vale of unavailing tears. I
        should have preferred going with my family to that blessed Utopia
        where there are neither births, deaths, marriages, divorces, breaches
        of promise, nor return tickets; only, unfortunately, I was not
        invited. So I became a posthumous orphan, soothed by Daffy's elixir
        and the skim-milk of human kindness. The milk was none too sweet,
        human kindness did not spare the rod, and I firmly believe it was
        Daffy's elixir that turned my hair red. However, I grew up at length
        into stand-up collars and tail coats, and at the age of seventeen
        springs was adopted (on trial) by a maiden aunt of seven-and-forty
        autumns. Like a gleam of sunshine hope flashed into my loveless life,
        lighting up my path to fortune. But it was only the glimmer of an
        <i>ignis fatuus</i>, which led me into a quicksand and snuffed itself
        out in a fog.</p>

            ONE EVIL-MINDED BLACK TOM.</p>

        <p>My relative had plenty of money, and plenty of other equally good
        qualities in the long run, no doubt; but the period of my adoption
        was too short to make sure of either the one or the other. If the
        wealthy maiden was really a worthy soul she did not let her nephew
        know it. Corporeally she was angular and iron-grey, with a summary
        tongue and wintry temper, chastened by a fondness for feline
        favourites. Unluckily, I was always falling foul of the latter, and
        my aunt continually fell foul of me in consequence. Crabbed age and
        youth could not live together in our case on account of cats. Age, as
        represented by the mature virgin, adored the brutes; youth, in the
        shape of a sprouting hobbledehoy, abhorred them altogether, and one
        evil minded black Tom in particular. My aunt called him Beauty, in
        happy ignorance that all her household called him a Beast. I admire
        beauty in the abstract; I also like it in the concrete; and in the
        concreted form of youthful feminine humanity I love it. But that
        feline black Beauty was the most outrageous misnomer unhanged. I had
        tried to hang him several times, down in the cellar in the dead of
        night; but his patent cast-iron neck set suspensory science at
        defiance, and Beauty triumphantly refused to give up the ghost. At
        first, he kicked and fought against it lustily, and yelled murder
        with all his might; but after a little practice the malefactor acted
        more philosophically, regarding the performance quite as part of his
        nocturnal programme. He never allowed it to make him late for
        breakfast, nor take away his appetite. Each morning, after execution,
        the moment the bell rang for prayers, in marched Beauty with a
        swollen head well on one side, growling anathemas from somewhere
        round the corner all prayer-time; after which the escaped convict
        devoured breakfast with the voracity of a stiffnecked cannibal.</p>

        <p>Finding the beast utterly unhangable, I determined to try
        drowning. My nature is by no means a cruel one, quite the reverse;
        but Beauty's cup of iniquity had long been full to the brim, and
        running over into the saucer. He had gulped down my canaries like
        pills, poached my pigeons, fricasseed my rabbits, and made himself an
        abominable beast generally; and had now committed a crime that capped
        everything.</p>

        <p>My cock bantam, which had won first prize at the Slocum-Pogis
        poultry show, mysteriously disappeared. Jim, the gardener's boy, and
        I hunted everywhere without finding any trace till we sighted Beauty.
        The beast was seated on my verbena bed, with fearfully distended
        stomach, waving my poor little bantam's tail feathers from between
        his teeth. Had I been an ancient Egyptian high priest, and Beauty at
        the top of the tree of holy cats, his diabolical godship should have
        been made into a mummy instanter. As things were, he had to be
        drowned forthwith.</p>

        AT A CABINET COUNCIL IN THE COAL CELLAR.</p>

            IN THE DESERTED OLD MILL.</p>
        </div>

        <p>At a cabinet council in the coal cellar, composed of the cook,
        footman, Jim, and myself, all the executive details were arranged; my
        aunt being, of course, kept in happy ignorance of our intentions. As
        soon as my respected relative uttered the preliminary snore of her
        afternoon siesta, Beauty made an involuntary exit out of the house,
        all the lower doors and windows having been carefully fastened. Then
        commenced a silent cat-hunt, a serio-comic drama in dumb show, with a
        crowded audience breathlessly gazing from the windows. The scenery
        was a series of dissolving views, beginning on a flower-decked lawn,
        and ending at a mill-pool a mile or so away from the audience. Beauty
        played leading actor with considerable activity, notwithstanding the
        drawback of being handicapped with an undigested bantam. He flew over
        dozens of flower-beds, through all the outhouses, over the stable,
        out into the park, up and down all the tallest trees, and all over
        the country, till he took refuge in the deserted old mill. There we
        wriggled him into an ancient sack, and tied him up in the harmonious
        company of a couple of brickbats. Then we committed the body to the
        deep. The burial service was short, but hearty.
        "One&mdash;two&mdash;three, and away!" sung out in unison, was the
        special form for the occasion, accompanied by Beauty's farewell
        blessing as we "awayed" him into the silent depths of the mill-dam.
        There was a splash, a shrill cry from a frightened moorhen, a short
        jubilate from Jim, to which I piously added "amen," and all was over.
        Jim ran home with half-a-sovereign in his pocket, while I walked back
        to dress for dinner. On the stairs I met my aunt, already in evening
        array, and looking hungry. I knew the sign, and stealthily tried to
        vanish, vainly.</p>

            "LATE AGAIN, SAMUEL!"</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Late again, Samuel!" she remarked, with a freezing
        spectacle-gleam that fixed me to the stair-carpet&mdash;my right foot
        two steps above the left. "You have just come in, I suppose. Have you
        seen Beauty?"</p>

        <p>Horror! Could she suspect anything? I felt my face growing the
        colour of my hair, and my tongue frozen solid.</p>

        <p>"Can't you answer?" she went on wrathfully. "And can't you stand
        up straight?"</p>

        <p>I pulled my legs together and commenced to stammer.</p>

        <p>"I&mdash;I saw Beauty out&mdash;outside, aunt, in the garden," I   managed
        to mutter.</p>

        <p>"Which way was he going?"</p>

        <p>"Why, I think he was running towards the house, aunt."</p>

            THIRTY MILES AN HOUR.</p>
        </div>

        <p>And then the remembrance of how he <i>was</i> running&mdash;thirty
        miles an hour, with tail on end and ears flat to his head, with Jim
        and my long-legged self racing in rear&mdash;made me choke with
        laughter I was forced to swallow. But my aunt's eyes were on me, and
        her gold-rimmed barnacles blazed through me, so I suffocated in
        silence.</p>

        <p>"Don't stand making faces like an idiot. Go and dress, and be
        quick," snapped my loving relative, as she marched away downstairs
        and I flew to the region above.</p>

        <p>My bedroom door was partly open, and I dashed in hastily, pulling
        off my things as I went.</p>

            A SHOW AT MUDDIFORD-ON-THE-OOZE.</p>
        </div>

        <p>My evening clothes were laid out ready on the bed, and&mdash;what
        was that on my shirt?&mdash;a black mass of&mdash;something
        moving!&mdash;some animal! Why, heavens and earth, it was the ghost
        of&mdash;that beast Beauty! It was Beauty himself! I ran for the
        poker; Beauty rushed out of the door. Confound that rotten old
        sack!</p>

        <p>I was late for dinner, and found Beauty seated in my chair, sleek
        and dry, with a ravenously whetted appetite. My aunt was so pleased
        with her favourite's improved appearance that she became quite
        affable, even to me. I was informed that as I had not been looking
        well lately I might go for a few days' change to the seaside; the
        salubrious air of Muddiford-on-the-Ooze would just suit me. What a
        blessing! To have escaped from those ice-gleaming spectacles and from
        that resuscitated beast Beauty I would gladly have gone to Jericho,
        much more to Muddiford-on-the-Ooze. Then my aunt continued her course
        of instructions, with the nearest approach to a smile I had ever seen
        on her face.</p>

        <p>"You will enjoy yourself, I am sure, Samuel, and you will also be
        able to show what pains you can take to please me," she said, sipping
        her first glass of Burgundy with approving relish. "There is to be a
        show at Muddiford the day after to-morrow, at which I intend
        exhibiting, and you will be able to manage everything for me; so mind
        you are careful to do your best."</p>

        <p>"I shall be most delighted," I declared gushingly. "What show is
        it? And what can I have the pleasure of taking charge of for you, my
        dear aunt?"</p>

        <p>"It's the Grand All-England Cat Show, and you will take Beauty;
        and I shall be greatly disappointed if you do not bring me back the
        first prize. So be on your best behaviour, Samuel, or perhaps you may
        live to regret it."</p>

        <p>My jaw dropped, and I thought I should have slid under the table.
        Good heavens! It was that beast Beauty who was to go for a holiday,
        while I was to act as the infernal fiend's keeper! O my prophetic
        soul&mdash;my aunt! But there was no help for it; I was bound in
        bonds of gold.</p>

            INTO ITS HADES-LIKE MOUTH.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="clear:left;">
            &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p>On the following day, Beauty and I were duly driven to the
        station, the former being luxuriously nested in a small hamper
        specially furnished for the occasion. About half-way on the road,
        just as we had mounted a long, steep hill, the cat managed to roll
        his residence from the stern of the dog-cart and trundle himself
        half-way home again. Luckily, he screeched blue murder at the tip-top
        of his voice, or we might not have missed the beast. As it was, his
        cyclical retrogression made us just too late for the train, and we
        had to wait two hours for the next. So I seated myself on the
        hamper&mdash;like Patience on the proverbial monument&mdash;and
        beheld the coachman depart homewards, with a sympathetic hat-touching
        salute, leaving me with a gloomy conviction of coming misfortune. The
        train, when it did arrive, was tolerably empty, and I secured a
        vacant first-class. For a time all went happily; then the cat
        commenced groaning.</p>

        <p>My aunt having solemnly ordered me to give the brute dinner, I now
        prepared to stop his mouth with cold chicken. While I was cautiously
        unfastening the hamper lid, Beauty remained quiet as a dormouse; and
        then he proceeded personally to assist the unfastening, with a
        vengeance. There was a bouncing volcanic eruption, a blood-curdling
        howl, a mixed-up whirling round the carriage, and
        then&mdash;smash!&mdash;bang through the window went
        Beauty!&mdash;leaving me doubled up on the seat, holding out half a
        chicken. It was a forty-feline-power hurricane, while it lasted; and
        drops of perspiration trickled down my nose on to the chicken, at
        which I sat stupidly staring. After a dazed pause I staggered to the
        broken window and looked out. There was Beauty, with a perpendicular
        tail like a young fir-tree, going like great guns in exactly the
        wrong direction. We had just come through a long tunnel, and the last
        I saw of my aunt's pet demon was as he dived headlong into its
        Hades-like mouth. And I had to take home first prize for him from the
        Grand All-England Cat Show!</p>

            WASHING HIS FIENDISH FACE!</p>
        </div>

        <p>When the 4.40 down express arrived at Muddiford-on-the-Ooze
        station, an auburn-haired youth limply emerged from a first-class
        carriage. In his arms he bore a basket, and his grey-green eyes
        gleamed with incipient catalepsy. Yes, such would undoubtedly have
        been my description had I posed as the momentary hero of a penny
        novelette. I forgot all about my luggage, imbecilely clinging to the
        late habitation of the lost beast Beauty, wandering I knew not why
        nor whither. Outside the station, round a quiet corner, my steps were
        arrested by the surprising sight of&mdash;Beauty!&mdash;the very
        identical devil himself! There stood the unhangable, undrownable,
        hurricane-creating beast, looking as serene as a newly-born black
        cherub, washing his fiendish face! I approached on tiptoe,
        breathlessly, with the basket behind my back and the half chicken
        extended as a peaceable card of introduction. He scented it
        instantly&mdash;my aunt always keeping Beauty's tit-bits until
        sufficiently gamey to suit his highly epicurean taste.</p>

        <p>With a finishing toe-touch to his whiskers, he amicably trotted up
        to me and&mdash;yes!&mdash;actually rubbed against my new trousers!
        What could have happened to him! Had his run through the tunnel
        turned him out virtuous? And how could he possibly have got here?
        Experience has shown that a leopard can change his spots, and a negro
        can grow spotted; but could a diabolical cat become even as a sucking
        dove and fly over twelve miles all in the space of twenty minutes?
        Impossible! So I put on a pair of folder-glasses and scrutinised this
        new arrival doubtingly. No; it was <i>not</i> Beauty&mdash;not nearly
        ugly enough. It was a twin, but larger, blacker, sleeker, a million
        times more amiable, and very much fatter. Ah!&mdash;ha,
        ha!&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;happy thought! Why not? I would. And,
        thereupon, I instantly did it.</p>

        <p>Placing the basket gently on the ground, I opened the lid and put
        in the cold chicken, when lo! in jumped the amiable twin. Half an
        hour later that basket, that heaven-descended twin, and that
        successful chicken, were safely deposited in custody of the cat-show
        steward, with the errant Beauty's entry ticket affixed. If the
        steward had never seen the real original he would never discover the
        difference; and if he did happen to be acquainted with the genuine
        article he could but think that the beast was surprisingly improved,
        and might even award it first prize for having turned over such a
        notable new leaf. And for the same reason, my aunt ought to be highly
        delighted at her favourite's favourable transformation. My heart was
        lightened of its oppressive troubles, as my hands were free from
        their feline load. With a hearty appetite I ate an excellent dinner
        at the hotel, went to the theatre, and turned into bed thankful for
        all fortune's favours.</p>

            I ATE AN EXCELLENT DINNER.</p>
        </div>

        <p>During the two following days, carefully steering clear of the
        cat-show, I enjoyed my freedom gaily, and had&mdash;what our
        three-thousand-miles-removed cousins would call&mdash;real good time.
        On the third morning a letter arrived from my aunt, with an enclosure
        which for the first moment I took to be a big cheque&mdash;a grateful
        offering, as I hoped, for services skilfully performed. However, it
        proved to be merely a second letter, in writing that was strange to
        me, and which with some curiosity I proceeded to peruse. As I
        unfolded the sheet, a vision suddenly crossed my mind of that savage
        beast Beauty; a chilly shiver shot through my marrow, and I sent the
        waiter for soda and brandy. It was an awful thought of what that
        unkillable cat might do! There he was, rampaging over a civilised
        country populated with children and lambs, and other unprotected
        innocents, half mad, perhaps, with hunger, where neither canaries nor
        pigeons, rabbits or cold chicken were grabbable. What desperate
        murders he might commit! And should I be held responsible? Here the
        timely arrival of the waiter helped to raise my spirits by a strong
        dose of B. and S., and I began the enclosed letter.</p>

            FOUR REMARKABLY FINE KITTENS.</p>
        </div>

        <p>It was headed from the cat-show secretary's office. Why, of
        course, that charming twin had got first prize, no doubt. Let us see.
        "Dear Madam," so ran the official note, "I beg to call your attention
        to what I imagine must, in some way, have been an oversight. Your
        cat, described on the entrance form as 'a black male, named Beauty,'
        which was, on the evening of its arrival, placed in the class
        pertaining to the descriptive form, was found this morning to have
        presented us with four remarkably fine kittens. This, of course,
        necessitated the family's removal from the male cat class. I have
        much pleasure in being able to inform you that both mother and
        kittens are in the best of health, and will be carefully attended
        upon. If you will kindly forward your instructions respecting their
        disposal, I shall be greatly obliged." That was the note, and wildly
        did the letters dance before my eyes.</p>

            GASPING FOR BREATH.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Having saved myself from fainting by finishing the B. and S., I
        sat for some minutes gasping for breath. Then I rubbed my eyes and
        reread that awful epistle. Yes&mdash;it was so&mdash;in solemn, sober
        black ink! Beauty's twin had got four fine kittens! Great
        Jehoshaphat! How could I ever get over those confounded kittens! It
        was too late to murder them. And my aunt&mdash;but stop! Let me read
        her letter; it might suggest something&mdash;some feline legerdemain
        method of conjuring four fine kittens into a first prize black male
        cat. So here goes. And this is how it went: "I always considered you
        to be a fool, Samuel, but nothing worse, until now. Unless the
        enclosed letter is immediately fully explained, and the matter set
        right, I shall plainly let you know what I do think of you now, and
        act accordingly. See the secretary, and telegraph me the result at
        once." Not much hope in that, worse luck; only a limited respite.</p>

            WENT FISHING.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Away I went to the show, saw the secretary&mdash;from a safe
        distance&mdash;and immediately telegraphed: "Have seen the secretary.
        Hard at work setting matters right. Awfully sorry." Then I hired a
        boat, and went fishing for the rest of the day. In the evening I
        wired: "Beauty must have got changed. Cats now all going home. Found
        clue and am following up. All right shortly." But my aunt's patience
        had expired. Next morning came a curt note saying she would at once
        join me, and either rescue Beauty or settle that secretary. How could
        I ever face those searching spectacles! I fled. From a lonely spot on
        the wilds of Dartmoor I wired: "Am following clue sharp. Getting
        close up. Good news next time." Back came an answer: "Shall be with
        you to-morrow at noon." At noon next day, I boarded the mail packet
        Tongariro, bound from Plymouth to New Zealand.</p>
